149. dona is regularly used in the sense oi dvodnnura: ct. Suet.
Iul. 54 templa deum donis resarta3 id. Naro quoted below.

151. Metal or wood was gilded by laying on thin plates of gold
(bratteae or lamminae), which could be prised off by the finger osa
thies ε cf. Martial quoted on 5, 41.

153. ‘Is he likely to stick at this, when he often melts down a
whole Jupiteri’: cf. Suet. Nero 32 templis compluribus dono detraxit
simulacraque ex auro vel argento fabricato conavit. The l. is unsatls·
sactory, because, apart from the exaggeration ol speaking of such a
crime as common, this is clearly not the business of a minor sacrilegus
but a greater crime thau even the robberies in ll. 147-149. Hence

155, 156. For this punishment, see n. to 8, ²143 the Ionos classicus
sor parricide and its singulare supplicium is Cic. pro Rosc. A m. 62-73.

deducendum, ‘him who deserves to be launched,’ i.e. parricidam: ·
the word is properly applied to a ship. ⁸

157. haec is probably tem. sing, in agreement with its predicate
pars: cf. nic est cibus (these things are the food) 14, 79: it refers to all
the crimes mentioned above, which are said to be only a fraction ot
those actually brought to justice: sor the constr., cl. 3, 613 Seu. Diae.

quota pars spectatur harenas? (where r'sta, though sem. sing. by attrac-
tion‚ refers to the labours of Hercules).

custos columnarum: Rutilius Gallicus was praefectus urbi under
Domitian, and Statius wrote a poem (Silo. i 4) on his recovery from an
illness nn. 88: Gallicus died in 91 0192 (Vollmer's Silone p. 10 n. a).
It should be noticed how Juv. here speaks os a personage oi nearly 40
years back, as if he were a contemporary. See lutrod. p. xxxiii.

The praefectus urbi, unlike most of the other praefecti, was a
senator: see u. to 4, 77: all the city police were under his orders, and
he had a large criminal jurisdiction in Rome and Italy. Seneca (Epp.
83, 14) also calls this official nestas urbis.

158. There are so many cases that the magistrate sits from dawn to
dusk, though it was usual to stop earlier: cf. Suet. Aug. 33 ipse ins
dixit assidue et in noctem nonnunquam. As a mle, the Romans began
work early (seen. to 14, 190) and did no business in the asternoon.

159. For the view of human nature to be obtained in a police·
court, cl. Boswell's Johnson (1874) 11 p. 342 ‘Johnson, who had an
eager and unceasing curiosity to know human lile'xrx autumnans&
