his immense reputation? He had great gifts, both of character
and intellect. He was evidently'a man oi stem and serious
temperament, an ardent admirer of the old Roman gravitas,
that combination of force and dignity on which the world-wide
Empire was based. This is the root whence springs his hatred
ol luxury, effeminacy, and indecorum on the part of public men.
He has no passages more pleasing than the short digressions,
where he describes the simple habits and plain meals os a
Fabricius or a Curius1,
