77. hlc, ‘hereupon,’ ‘atthis point': cf. 3, 21. Preads hinc, but is
not followed even by Biich.

78. est illum: cf. 3, 264 and n. there.

80. menesatem edit, ‘devoured him and gnawed his bones’:
the nature of the case shows that tbe action described in the participle
cannot, in spite of the tense, precede the action of the verb: see n. to 5,
68.

81. decoxitt some word for ‘roasting’ must be supplied out of
this to go with veribus.

83. crudo: the epithetis sometimes applied, by an extension of
meaning, to the eater of raw flesh and especially human flesh: ef. Mart.
iv 49, 4 cerrum, mede Thyesta, tuam3 Ovid Heroid. 9, 67 crudi Diome
dr's image, Ι efferus humana qui dape pavit equus.

84. hle: cf.l. 77. Firewasbrought down from heaven and would
have been profaned by being used for such a purpose. The subject to
violaverit is actrix turba.

86. Some edd. bracket from elemento to reor: but here as so often
elsewhere there is no proof of interpolation. The difficulty lies in te,
which is taken by some to refer to fire, by others to Volusius, the friend
to whom the satire is addressed. ln the first case, the sudden apo·
strophe to fire is very awkward3 in the second, the reference to Volusius,
who has been dropped since the first line and does not appear after this,
is not less so. On the whole, considering that several of the satires are
addressed to a perhaps imaginary friend who figures only in the first
line (so Fuscinus Sat. 14, Gallius Sat. 16, and see n. to 6, 28), it seems
more likely that fire itself is apostrophised.

88. sustinuit: cf. 6, 1053 14,127.

89-92. The sense is: the guilt being so great, you may well ask
'bether even the first to eat found pleasure in the taste: but you need
ot, for the last was as eager as the first.

89. ne quaeras and ne dubites are, is the text be sound, both
rohibitions, and not final clauses. There are no other instances of
‚his constr. in Juv.

90. autem offers another difficultyz some word like nam or enim
or immo is wanted. In earlier Latin autem often means ‘in turn,’ but
only of the second of apair: Plautus, Lucretius, and Cicero use it so:
here this meaning is inadmissible. The word is probably corrupt. If
sc, from scelere to senserit may be a parenthesis, containing a final

sentence which introduces an ind'nect question.
