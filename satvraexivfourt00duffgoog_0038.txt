there are fragments in prose and in half-a-dozen different metres.
ln Petronius the narrative is written in prose3 and the poetry·
inserted in the narrative is generally placed in the mouth of a
speaker with some formal introduction. For variety of subject,
the fragments of Lucilius are perhaps the best example. His ¹
work might have been called ‘The Life and Opinions of Gaius
Lucilius' He simplyput on paper the thoughts passing through
his mind; and it is an accident, due to the times in which he
lived, that his thoughts turned largely on public affairs and the
misconduct of public men. The true modern parallel to Lucilius
is to be found in such works of sels-revelation as Montaigne’s
Essays. Beside the romance of Petronius we may set Borrow’s
Lavengro: it also has no plot, and consists of a succession of
isolated scenes and dialogues. ln both books the narrator is
unchanged; and so a certain degree of continuity is secured.
Of satire proper, the form which satura ultimately assumed,
the classical English authors are Dryden‚ Pope, and Swift.
But in English literature the development has been different;
and a more faithful image of the ancient satura, its discursive,
personal, and humorous character, and its freedom from rhetoric,
will be found in the passages where Thackeray drops his
narrative for a time and addresses himself directly to the
reader.

III. JUVENAL As A SATIRIST.

The development of satura has now been traced from its
first appearance as a rudimentary form of drama down to the
romance of Petronius. lt remains to consider how it was
manipulated by Juvenal, the last and the most powerful of the
Roman satirists.

But, before discussing Juvenal's literary method and ethical

, purpose, it is desirable to point out the remarkable difference
between his earlier and later satires. The dividing line comes

after the ninth satire, which is the last of the third book. This
difference mav be due partly to advancing years and failing
