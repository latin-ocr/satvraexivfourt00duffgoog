nouus. 4 431

constr. is very awkward3 and l. 449 is not found in some mss. and is
bracketed by Jahn. Perhaps et laeuo is corrupt: et is strange, and the
Schol‘s comment (subtili monitu) seems unsuitable to laevo.

448. et, ‘also’ laavo=sinisera produnt, ‘brings up’: cf. 6, 444.

4 3ο. effundit habenas: he lets his team get the bit in their mouths
and finds it too late to check them. The metaphoris common in Latin,
eg. Virg. Georg. ii 364 (os the vine) palmes...loxis per purum inmissus
habenam Livy xxxiv 4, 43 (Cato speaking in defence ol the lex Oppia
tac. 195) date frenos impotenti naturae et indomito animali (ie. women)
et sperate rpsas modum licentiae jacturas. ι

434. quem si revoces, ‘and it you try to stop him,’ ie. your son.
Biich. takes curriculum as antecedent of quem, the Latin grammarians
vouching sor a form curriculum but it seems likely that partos the
evidence lor the form was supplied by this passage misunderstood.

434. adeo here is corrective and means, ‘rathen' with a sense like
immo. In particular phrases it has this meaning osten: cl. Cic. in Verr.
ii 3, 44 tolonnis atqueadeo (or rather) saec'ulr'53 ibid. 444 nova lege atque
adeo nullo lege. See Palmer’s n. to Plaut. Amph. 677 quam omnium
Thebis m'r unam esse optumam diiudicat, {quamque odeo cives Y'leebour'
vero rumiferant probam 3 also Tyrrell's n. to cic. ad Art. i 17, 9 ego
princeps in adiutoribus atque adeo secundus.

Transi. ‘not a bit os it l they give themselves freer licence'

For the sentiment, cf. Seu. Dial. iii 7, 4 (os anger) quarumdam
rerum initia r'n nostra potestate sunt, ulteriora nos oi rapiunt uec regres-
sum relinquam ibid. 8, 1 (anger, if once suffered to begin) faciet de
cetero quantum volet, non quantum permueris.

433. santum, sc. eum esse. Juv. may have in mind the scenes‚
common in Plautus, where a prudent father dissuades his son from
helping an extravagant friend: eg. Tn'nummus 11 4.

donet: this verb has generally an acc.; but cf. 5, 111 dommagoum
Mart. iv 40, 7 iam donarepotes, iam perdere.

437. The apodosis begins here. The first et is ‘both' circum·
aarum: see n. to 15, 136.

438. amor, sc. tantus ert.

239. Morum: see n. to 8, 434.

44ο. Menoeceus, acting on a prophecy oi Teiresias, stabbed him-
sels to secure victory for Thebes against the seven invaders (Stat.
raa. x 648-784). Here again Jnv. expresses distrust oh tae seembs
os Graece. and nith better reason than ‘su io, vla.
