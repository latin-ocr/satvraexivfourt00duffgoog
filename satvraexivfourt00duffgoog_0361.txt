extant, nt sitsi qnoque qni egenent nan aliis magr‘s erationibus cen-
scantur ; Pliny Paneg. 15 quisquis paulo vetustior miles, Ιιίι te cammi-
Iitane censetur (ie. the most remarkable thing about him is, that he has
served with Trajan).

ptati vultus m. are the imagines above spoken of.

3. in curribus, ie. atriumphal statue3 cf. 7, 125.

Aemilianos: the termination shows that a member of the gens
Aemilia had been adopted into another gens, as Octavius became
Octavianus, when adopted into the gens Iulia Α son of Aemilius
Paulus, when adopted by P. Cornelius Scipio, added Aemilianus to
the name of his adopting father; in after years he was the conqueror of
Carthage, the second of the dna fulmina belli.

4. tam dlmtdtos, ‘mutilated by time': cf. 15, 5. humeros, lit.
‘as tothe shoulders '3 ‘minus the shoulders‚’ we might say.

5. The emperor Galba was of a very ancient family, whose
antiquityhe exaggerated sofar, ut imperator stemma in atre'aprapasnem't,
qua palmeam mmmm ad Iovem, maternam ad Pasiphaam Minois
texerem referret (Suet. Galb. a). If, as Marquardt supposes, the stemma
was identical with the imagines, are we to believe that he had a wax
mask of Jupiter on his wall? The name of the god on a family-trec
would be much more permissible.

6. eenerls tabu1a=stemnmta a sort of key to the imagines to
which Juv. is returning aster the mention of statues.

7. The repetition of corvinum and the weakness of posthac have led
some critics to suspect interpolation3 for posthac, Withof ingeniously
suggested passe ac. In sonte mss. the l. is omitted, in others Fabricium
is found for Caeninum. But Juv. may well have written the l. as P
gives it, with all its diffuseness.

multa...vlrga, ‘to claim kinship through many a branch with...’:
virgae are the lineae which connect one part of the stemma with
another: so ramus Pers. 3, aa. For this sense of contingere, cf. 11, 62
and Suet. Galb. a Neroni Galba successit nulla gradu contirzgens
Caesarum dantum.

8. fumosos: cf. Mart. viii 6, 3 argenti fumosa...stemmata; the
imagines, being kept in the atrium, ‘the blackened room,' naturally got
blackened with smoke in course of time.

9. quo, ‘what is the use of...?’ angles is probably accus..
governed by some verb understood: cf. l. run, rs, xgr, numos. Ell-
i 5, re qna mehe'fartnnam with Wllklns’ nole.

11. armannum: this cognomen was conferred on gffi'xo hs& x
