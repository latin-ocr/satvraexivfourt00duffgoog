71—145. Enough said to a sehish aristocrat like Rubellius Blandus:
you, Ponticus, will not, J hope, be sotufied to mpeud an the
distinctions of your ancestors. Fulfil all the duties of a good
citizen, oud tell the truth at any cast to yourself. Some day you
will become governor of a province ,· there is temptation there, hutI
hope you will pity the poor provinciale ond restrain your avorice.
It is tenu thot earlier depredatione have stn'ppod the provinces
almost bare: the great harvests of a Verres have le only slender
gleanings for later rulers. And rememhor not to provohe the
unetched too for ,· what may he done safoly in the East may provehe
armed resistanee in the West. What I say is said in earnest: ej
you are a good govenur and insist on good conduct in your
subordinatas, then you may make unchallonged any protensions
you please to noble birth ,· hut ifyou are crcul and rapacious, nobility
only makes your wichedness more conspicuous. Ifyau are a fhrger
and a prtytigute‚ I think nothing of the distinctions of your ancestors.

the most of them.

expect, that the youth addressed is no longer living. The description
does not agree with what Tacitus says ol Rubellius Plautus: cf. esp.
Ann. xiv aa, 3 and 57, 5.
