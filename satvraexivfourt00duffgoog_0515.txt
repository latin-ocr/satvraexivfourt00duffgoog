nm. 77) hama sceeri,¹ humani nil a ene alienum puto.

ideo, ‘for that reason) The logie is dubious: because we have
the power of sympathy, therefore we have it (l. 146).

venerabile, ‘worthy of reverence': some explain ‘reverentiaL'
which certainly harmonises with diuinarum capaces: but it seems
doubtful whether Juv. would use an adj. of this form with an active
sense: see n. to ra, 73. They are common in earlier poets: see Munro’s
n. to genitabilis Lucr. i 11. Martial (iv 19, 9) has frigus penetrabile
(=qucdpenctrat); but that may be a reminiscence of Virgil.

146. As Juv. cannot mean to deny that animals have ‘sensation‚'
eeneue must here mean much the sameas continueris sensus, ‘sympathy,’
as we use ‘feeling': see n. to 8, 73.

147. Α reminiscence of Ovid Met. i 84 pronaque cum spectent
animaliaccteratmam, Ι as haminisublimcdcditcaelumque ardere l iussit

148. communie condstor, ‘the creator of both us and them.’

149. Where anime and animus are contrasted, the former is ‘the

cf. Sen. Epp. 58, 14 quaedam (sc. animantia) animum habent, quaedam
tantum ammam.

150. adfecturi, ‘friendly feeling': the word is used by classical
writers to denote only ‘a feeling '3 it bas the sense of studium or gratia
occasionally in silver-age Latin: see n. to 6, 114.

luberet is final, not consecutive. The Creator gave mankind an
instinct intended to produce civilisation.

153. letibus, ‘home 'z a single household is properly called either
lar or penates, each household having one of the former and two of the
latter: cf. 8, 143 14, no: but lares is often used of a single house, eg.
Mart. i 7ο, 1 irc iuberis Ι ad Proculi nitidas, afficr'ose, lares.

155. delleta nduota, ‘confidence born of union’: it is=calla·
tarum fidenae.

157. defendier is to be noticed as one of the very few archaisms
in Juv.: duelli (1, 169) is another, but perhaps forms part of a
proverb. defendier hasanepic sound: chirg„ Amtnffi. 'annm
