carried too sar by the older editors, of supposing that, wherever
the same name occurs in the two poets, they both refer to the
same person. This is a mistake. For Martial‚ as we know
from himself ¹, consistently used fictitious names in his satirical
epigrams. Juvenal’s practice was quite different. He only
attacked persons who were not in a position to resent it—those
who were no longer living, or had been condemned by· a
judicial sentence, or were of no social importancet Hence he
mentions many persons of whom we know nothing from any
other source ; but there is no reason io believe that he uses
any fictitious names, with the possible exception os the cor-
respondents (Postumus, Ponticus, Calvinus, Gallius), to whom
some of the later satires are addressed.

Il. THE SATURA BEFORE JUVENAL 'f—

lt was the boast of Roman writers and critics³ that satire
was a genuine national creation, that they had invented lor
themselves, and not borrowed from Greece, at least one im·
portant kind ol literature. The claim of originality must be
allowed, although satire was much influenced, at more than
one period of its history, by Greek example.

Roman satire, however, has nothing to do with the Satyric
drama of Athens. The word satura probably means ‘medley,'
being a feminine noun derived from satur, like dira ‘a curse'
and noxia ‘a hurt.’ lt seems to have been applied originally

¹ Mart, ipraef. ; ii ²33 ix 953 x 33. For the practice of combining
real and fictitious names in satirical writing, cf. Pliny Epp. vi 21, 5 (oi
Vergilius Romanus who had composed a play in imitation os the Old
Comedy) insectatus ert vitia, fictis nominibus decenter, veris urus
est apte. ‘
