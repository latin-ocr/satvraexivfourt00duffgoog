affects intellect, cl. Hor. Epp. ii r, ²44 Boeotum in crasso iurares aere
notum and Wilkins' n. there.

51. nec non et: the same pleonasm was used 3, 204.

53. ‘Bade her go hang, and shook his fist at ber’: the ‘fist’ is a'n
equivalent, not a translation, the ancients using the hngers, especially
the middle finger, to eonvey opprobrious insults to an adversary: cs.
Sen. Dial. ii 5, a lacrimas evocant nomina porum grata auribus et
eh'gitorum motus. Hence it was known as infamis, impudicus: cs.
Mart. vi 70, 5 ostendit damen, sed impudicum, Ι Alconti Dasioque
Symmachoque, ‘be shows, nothis wristbut his fist, to all the doctors ’3
so iu French il mantra le poing au ciel.

54-113. Is it true that even innocent objects of prayer are useless or
even harnful l Great place is exposed to great enoy and often
brings ruia ou its possessors. Consider the instance of Sejanus,
how his Jhllfrom the second place in the world was hailed with joy
by the very populace, which used to worship him. A little change
os fortune, and he me'grht have cneshed Tiberius and been emperor
himself ; hut now all are eager to trample on the fallen. Would it
be better to be Sejanus, the possessor ofboundless power and wealth,

and then to foll from thot herirht, or to pass sasely through life as a
poor little prouinceal magistrate? Sosianus, at least, was wrong
when he prayedfor wealth and power ,· and so was Crassus, and
Pompey‚ and Julius Caesar. For tyrants seldom die in their beds.

54, 55. All uss. read autperniciosa petuntur, where hals a foot is
wanting. Some word must be inserted ; and, as vel is osten expressed in
uss. by a symbol like t, it may have fallen out after aut. Many further
corrections have been suggested3 that 01 Mr H. Richards (Classical

l Review ii p. 326) is here adopted. Juv. asks ‘are we then to dcem

, those things superfluous or even (ael) banesul‚ i'or which men offer
innocent prayer to heavenl’ He answers by showing from examples
that power (11. 56-113), eloquence (114-132l, success in war (133,-
187), long lise (res-288), and beauty (289-345), all legitimate objects
01 prayer, have all brought rnin on their possessors. He then asks,
nil ergo optabunt homimss For the form 01 the sentence, Mr Richards
compares r, 158 qui dedit ergo trihus patruis aconita, vehatur Ι pensili-
hus plumis atque illinc despiciat nos?

Biiclr. inserts quae before perniciosa, and puts a question astet 110111
pwunmr and deorum he also attacbes the 0011010110 nse vestm,

paragraph, with which it seems to hine 110 consensu.
