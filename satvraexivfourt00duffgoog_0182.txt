sortis at hostium Ι victor Maeonii carminis alite ; aud many oi the other

instances given, eg. Juv. 13, 124 curentur dubii madriu maioribus aegri,
are undoubtedly dative, as is shown by the personal pronouns which
have different forms ior dat. and abl The dat. aiter any part oi the
passive verb rs common in all latin poets.

os the pres. subj.1s oi constant occurrence; in Cicero it usuallyexpresses
a general maxim: ci. de Off. iii 82, where εὐσεβεῖν χρεών is translated
by pictatem colas. Livy aud later writers use it also as an imperative ad-
dressed to an individuae eg. Livy xxvi 50, 7 amicus papalaRamana sis.

temne: the semla (νάρθηξ), and scutica (luds), the cane and tawse,
were the weapons with which the schoolmaster of antiquity carried on
war against ignorance and idleness. Juv. says that he, no less than
others, has been caned at school, and gone on to college. Roman boys,
when they had learnt the three R's from the litteratar'or ludi magister,

went next to the grammaticus, whose chief business was to teach
grammar and to expound the poets: see n. to 6, 450. Such time as the
grammaticus <lid not claim might be given to mathematics (geometria)
and music.

16. The education, thus begun, was completed in the school oi the
rizctar or ‘professor oi rhetoric.' The exercises mainly practised there
were oi two kinds: (ι) suasoriae, (a) controversiae. The suasoria was
practised first: the pupil delivered a declamation which might be put
in the mouth of some famous man on a historieal occasion, or might be
addressed to him (hence the name] as, in the instance here quoted, to
Sulla. A large number of stock themes have been preserved in
M. Seneca and Quintilian: eg. Quint. iii 8, 19 deliberat C. Caesar an
perseueret in Germaniam ire, cum milites passim testamenta facerent.

For Hannibal, ci. Juv. 7, 160.
The controversia was not a monologue, but a debate which pro·

sessed to observe legal forms and to represent the proceedings of a
law-court, the pupils aeting as counsel engaged in the case. But the
circumstances supposed were generally quite unlike those oi real liic:
the magician, the pirate, and the pirate's sympathetie daughter are some
os the standing characters. The same ease was debated an infinite
number oi times; and the ambition oi the pupil was to import some
novelty rnto the well· ·worn theme, to suggest some calar (line oi defencey
more absurd and ingenious than altitu predecessore ihus tue eon
troversia served the same purpose as the iamous suit oi Peebtes α otest
