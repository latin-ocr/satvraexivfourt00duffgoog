public bathingestablishments, in Rome at this time, those of Agrippa,
Nero, and Titus. ΤΙιε balnea Phoebi would be a smaller bath, kept by
a man of that name, like the baths of Lupus and Gryllus mentioned by
Martial.

knowledge of this kind: so the emperor Tiberius (Suet. Tib. 70)
gramnaticos...a·usmodi sere quaestionibus* experiebatur, quaa mater
Hecubae, quod Achilli nonam inter virganssfuissaa quid Sirenes cantara
sint solitae. For Quintilian’s opinion of such learning, seen. to 6, 451.
Anchemolus and his step-mother occur in the Aen. x 3893 Acestes
entertained Aeneas in Sicily and supplied him with wine, Am. v 7 3 loll.

hide away her portraits too.’

not allowed to receive a reward of more than five aurei. But it stilla

remains uncertain in what sense an actor couldbe victorin a Roman,¹
