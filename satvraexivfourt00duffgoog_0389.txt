250. excipit, ‘faced,’ lit. ‘is ready to receive'3 a word taken from
field-sports: ef. Seu. Diel. iii rr, a on tu putor venatorem irasci seris?
otqui ct vementes excivit rt fugientes persequitur, et ommia illa sine iro
socii ratio. quid Cimbrorum Teutonorumque tot milia superfusa A Ιριῦω
sustulit,...uisi quoderat illis pro virtute iro?

²51· cimbros stragemque, ‘the heaps of slain Cimbri,’ a torm oi
hendiadys common in Latin poetry.

²5²· maiora cadavera: the great size of the Germans is often
remarked on; cf. Tac. Germ. ao in omui domo nudi oc sordidi iu hos
artus, in hoec corpora, quae miramur, excrescunt.

253. Catulus triumphed together with Marius, but was altogether
thrown into the shade by his colleague, partly because M.'s victory at
Aquae Sextiae the year before had made the final triumph possible, but

also, according to Mommsen, because of the desire for a democratic
revolution in which it was hopcd that Marius might lead the way.

254· P. Decius Mus gave up his life to save the Roman army in
battle against the Latins ae. 3403 his· son, of the same name, repeated
the act of heroism in the battle of Sentinum against the Samnites

255. totis is used t'or omuibus, a licence which first appears in
silva-age poets: cl. 6, 61; Martial seems certainly to use totis de'ebus in
the sense of touslesjours: cf. ii 5, 1;iv 37,6; iv 54, 3.

257. The Romans were warned by a dream oi both consuls, that
the gods of the world below required the sacrifice oi the general com-
manding one oi the two armies; whichever army lost its general, would
be victorious, but the other army was doomed. Decius accordingly
sacrificed his lile, devoting himself in the following form: pro republica
populi Romani Quiritium...legiones auxilioque hostium mecum deis
Manibus Tellurique devoveo (Livy viii 9, 8). The son repeated his
fathe?s words and action, sorty·five years later (Livy x 28, 1¹5).

258 was condemned by Dobree, acutely: the l. is wealr in itself, and
its form (enim) is like an inserted explanation oi what precedes; but
that Juv. had better not have written it, is no proci that he did not.
