vaurum Thebanam magna vestigia. The city, which in Homeris times
was the richest and greatest in the world (Il. ix 381 soll), is called vetio,
to distinguish it lrorn Thebes in Greece, of Seven Gates, for which see n.
to 13, 17.

7. tute uluroa: the reading of P is a'llr'caemleos, of other MSS. ilic
caeruleos: Biich. adopts the latter, saying that the antithesis requires it,
caendeus being defined in various collectione of glosses as bestia marina:
the sea-lish is thus opposed to the river-tish.

Against this, it is pointed out by Friedl, that this noun caeruleus
probably owes its existence to this passage alone3 that illic caemleos is
a most natural, though wrong, correction ol illicamdcosy and that it
would be surprising that Juv. should omit here the most sacred of all
Egyptian animals, the cat (αἰλουρος); cf. Herod. ii 66 and ⁶7³
Anaxandr. ap. Athenaeum 3οο (a Greek addressing an Egyptian) τὸν
αἰέλουρον κακὸν ἔχοντ’ ἐὰν ἴδῃς, Ι κλαίεις, ἐγὼ δ’ ἥδιστ’ ἀποκτείνας δέρω.

It is a singular fact that the ‘harmless, necessary cat,’ while
cherished in such numbers in Egypt, was unknown in Greek and
Roman households: no skeletons have been found at Pompeii, and the
mouse·catching animala, which are sometimes mentioned (γαλέη, maar-
tela, faelis etc), were probably all os the weasel or marten kind. The
domestication ol the cat is a modern event, compared with that ol the
dog, and was first effected in Egypt.

fluminis, i.e. the Nile, the only river in Egypt. For the sacred tish,
especially eels‚ ci. Herod. ii 71, and Anaxandr. l. l. 299 τὴν ἔγχελυν
μέγιστον ἡγεῖ δαίμονα Ι ἡμεῖς δὲ τῶν ὄψων μέγιστον παρὰ πολύ.

8. The dog was another sacred animal: cf. Herod. ii 66 and 67;
Cic. de Leg. 31 qui canem et faelem ut deos colunt: and see n. to Anubis
6, 532.

The point ol the opposition is that Diana as Hnntress‚ was mistress
of the dog, and that dogs were osten sacriticed on her altars.

9. porrum at caepe: cf. Hor. Epp. i 11, 11 seu ponam ct caepi
trucidas (perhaps Iccius, whom heis addressing, was os Egyptian
descent).

ro. This refers to the belief that the gods revealed themselves only
to innocent men in an innocent age: seen. to 6, 19, aml cf. Catull. 64,
383 praesentis namque ante domm inviserecartas Ι heroum, et sese mortali
ostendere coetu, Ι caelicolae nondum spreta pietate solebant. The vegeta-
bles are ‘home-made’ gods (domi natal.
