Cf. Seneca (Haase iii p. 454) si nauti fuz'ssaat Cicera et Demo·
sthenes, ct antius vixissent at lenius obiisent.

114. ac tamam: sothe inferior Mssa P, followed by auch„ reads
aut samam. Cf. Tac. Ana. i 8, 3, where Nipperdey reads aa for aut of
Mss. A distributive sense of aut is found in silver-age Latine e.g. Tac.
Ana. xi 38 iugula aut pectori (ie. now to her throat‚ now to her breast)=

but such a sense is impossible here, because the orator's fame is in-
separable from his eloquence.

It has already been pointed out that eloquence was the object towards
which the whole of Roman edueation was directed, the instruction of
the grammatino being considered merely preparatory to the formal
rhetorical training which followed, and completed the curriculum: see
n11.tor,15and16.

115. The Quinquatrus was an annual feast of Minerva, March 19-
a 3, especially observed by teachers and scholare, she being the goddess
of wisdom: edd. quote Ovid Fasti iii 809 fiunt sacra Minima!
nomina quaa iunctis quinqua datus labaat3 ibid. 815 Pallada nunc
pueri temracqua orata patellae. Ι qai bena placarit Pallada, doctus m't.

totta, i.e. during all the five days of the feast.

116. Minervam is generally explained as ‘learning’ and the as as
the boy’s fee to his teacher. This explanation seems to be due to the
epithet parcam. But the evidence is against such a low fee as one as: .
Horace mentions 8asses a month as the fee in an elementary country
school (Sat. i 6, 75). On the other hand, an as is often mentioned as
the amount of a stips or contribution to a god’s treasury: aa and stips
are even used as synonyma: thus the saying of Augustus, reported by
Quint. vi 3, 59 nali timere, quasi assam elephanto des, reappears in
Suetonius (Aug. 53) with arsam changed to stiacm. Therefore it seems
lilrely that the as is neither a fee nor a present to the master, but a stips
offered by the little boy to the goddess of wisdom, who can make him
wise. Cf. Petron. 88 quis unquam venitin templum et vatam jecit, si
(011 condition of) ad eloquentiam pervenisset? (ivhere the context shows
that this was a right thing to do). A difficulty remains in the epithet ’
parcam. The Schol- explains vilioris pretii fictile Minervae sagnam:
I would rather transl. ‘economical‚' the quality, which properly belongs
to assa, being transferred to the goddess: see n. to ra, 82: cf. Mart.
viii 33, 11 (of a strena or new-year's gift, in the form 01 a cygnaeo aaa
