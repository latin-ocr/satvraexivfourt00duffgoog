208 JUVENAL, V.

N either law nor public opinion allowed the uror and concubina to live
under the same roos.

Nor do the objections to the old interpretation convince me: (r) Virro
might well be ungracious to Trebius and yet be willing to spend a few
peuce on the children; nor (a) was it illegal‚ or at all improbable, that
such a person as Trebius should marry a libertina, who bore, atter the
nomen other patron, some name like Mycale (perhaps Megale, the exact
spelling of the word is quite uncertain). The Index to Wilmanns’
[ascriptions gives hosts of similar female names, such as Cedne, Dorcas,
Sabbatha, and Samna3 each oi these four have Claudia prefixed; but
Juv. does not wish to use a complimeutary title here.

The digression in ll. 141-145 is strikingly irrelevant3 but such
irrelevanceis common in Juv. The words sterilis uxor suggested a new
thought, that the poor man is an exception to the rule laid down; and
five verses are at once written to express this, in which he makes Virro
behave much better to the children than to their father.

142. semel: so Buch. with P: but this would surely mean that
M. could have no more children: so perhaps Hermann is right in
preferring simrd of the inferior uss. See Bentley on Hor. Sat. ii 8, 24,
where there is the same discrepancy between mss.

143. nido, ‘your'young ones' The ‘green waistcoat‘ is perhaps
ι miniaturc of the green tunic (vindis parmi 11, 198) worn by one ol the Ἴ
chariot-drivers at the races3 boys and men alike took a passionate
interest iu these contests: cl. Suet. Nero io quondam tractum prasinum
agitatorem (the ‘green' driver) inter condiscipulos querens, obiurgante
paedagogo, do Hectore sa loqui ementitus σείς Tac. Dial. 29 poeno in
utero matris concipi mili videntur histrionalis favor et gladiatorum
equorumque studia. The garment is ior the children to play with; so
are the nuts, which were to the children oi antiquity much what
marbles are to our own, with the advantage that they were good to eat.
Sometimes a benevolent man provided by will sparsio nucum inter
pueros. Virro is too economical to provide any but the smallest
kind.

145. The ‘infant parasite‘ is Trebius’ son.

146. ancipites mugi, ‘doubtful sunguses': ie. there is considerable
risk in eating thern: ct'. Lucan vi ιη letumque minantes Ι vellere (to
pluclc) ab gnotus dubias radicibus herbas; Mart. iil 60, 5 sunt tibi

lalemj frangas ego sumo suillos.
¹47· Μ, ‘yes, and... ,’ has the sense ol et quidem, sol saurae see
η’ ω 4’ ²7· JUV· seems to borrow here hom thart-'r selemim*
