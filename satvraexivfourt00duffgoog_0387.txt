inferiority which the nobiles made him feel. Cicero and Marius were
both nativos ol Arpinum in the Volscian country.

birth to the second order oi the Roman aristocracy, who were small
men at Rome though great men in the provincial towns; his own
talents enabled him to bridge over the guli fixed between an eques
Ronmnus and α senator: he calls himself equitis Romani filius

their relation to Augustus: cf. Plut. Cicero 49 πυνθάνομαι δὲ Καίσαρα ·

elder Pliny, Quintilian, Martial, und Juvenal, are unanimous and
enthusiastic in his praise. His oratorical style is criticised by a speaker
in Tacitus’ Dauloguc cc. aa and a 3. ⁷
