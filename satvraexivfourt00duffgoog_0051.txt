INTRODUCTION.

hoc volo, sic iubeo: sit pro ratione voluntas.

sed quis custodiet ipsos
custodes?

occidit miseros crambe repetita magistros.

summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori
et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.

dum serta, unguenta, puellas
poscimuS, obrepit nou intellecta senectus.

cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.

expende Hannibalem: quot libras in duce summo
iuvenies?

ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris.

maxima debetur puero reverentia.

In some ol these phrases a common thought is expressed
with great epigrammatic skill; but they are by no means all
conrmonplaces. The last may have sounded even paradoxical
to readers who thought that reverence should be reserved lor
old age; but the paradox is admirable in its truth and force.
Again, there is a bitter, and not obvious, truth in the saying,
that the worst sting of poverty is that it makes the poor man
ridiculous.

One of the characters in Victor Hugo's novel, Les Mr'rdrables,
had learned Latin lor the sole purpose of reading Juvenal, who
represented in his eyes all that was worth reading in the
language. This was a hasty judgrnent; for Juvenal is not one
ot the greatest names in Latin literature. But hisgreat literary
gist and his honest purpose have made his lame secure. For
our own age his satire ought to have a special interest3 as there ·
are considerable resemblances between modern society in greatt
cities and the busy lise that surged before Juvenal's eyes 51²
Rome just eighteen centurias ago.
