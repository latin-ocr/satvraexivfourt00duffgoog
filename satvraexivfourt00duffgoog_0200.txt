136 JUVENAL, 111.

3. The Sibyl, who sold her prophetie books on such strange terms
to Tarquinius Superbus, had her cavam at Cumae; and those who
live there are said to be her citizens. There is an odd legend about her
in Petronius (c. 4⁸)= Trimalchio, himself a resident at Cumae, says he
once saw her hangiug up in a bottle and heard her say to the children
who asked her what she wanted, “I want to die.'' Dr James (Classical
Reuiew vi p. 74) has shown that this is a Tithonus-myth: as Tithonus
shrunk to a grasshopper, so the Sibyl has shrunk through age to the
proportions of an insect and is anxious, like him, to give up her im·
mortality. It is some confirmation of this that Statius (Silv. iv 3, 151)
mentions Tithonus and the Sibyl together.

4. Baiae, the Roman Brighton, stood on the peninsula of which
Cape Misenum forms the aper3 Cumae is called the gate of Baiae,
because it stood at the base of the peninsula.

5. secessus: gen. of definition, like vox voluptatis, ‘the word
pleasure.’ This should not be explained as a gen. of quality; for a
noun, to which the latter is attached, does not take an adjective,
whereas littus here has gratuma see n. to 1. 48. Prochyta, now
Procida, a srnall island off Misenum, serves as a type of desolation3 the
Subura was one of the chief streets of Rome, leading eastwards from
the forum to the Esquiline gate.

7. incendia: fires were of constant occurrence in ancient Rome.
The houses were high, the streets were narrow and blocked up with
booths and shops‚ mostly made of wood. The ground-fluor had usually
no rooms opening on the street, and no windows; so that these
encroachments on the public way, however inconvenient for traffic and
likely to spread fire, were attached to many of the dwelling-houses. Α
special corps of firemen (vigiles) was instituted nt). 6 by Augustus;
they were 7,ooo in number, commanded by a praefectur, and distributed
among the fourteen regiones of the city. Rich individuals seem to have
had private fite-brigades: cf. 14, 305.

tapam tactorum: cf. ll. roo-196. The jerrybuilder saw his oppor-
tunity in ancient Rome, as he always will, where land is dear aud
population constantly increasing. On the other hand, the public
buildings of that age still astonish us by their stability.

9. augusto...manae: cf. a, 70 sed lulius ardet. The mouth
Quintilis was called Iulius alter the reform of the Roman calendar by
Caesar lac. 46, his birthday falling in that month. The ignorance

of the pontifices, who inserted an extra day every third instead ot auena
’ s⁰²¹fll¹ year, made a further correction necessarii m Augustusne-h
