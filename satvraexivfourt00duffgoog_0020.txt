X INTRODUCTION.

lt is probable that the De Viris Illustribus was published before
114 nn. For the younger Pliny, who died in that year, was not
one ol the authors included in the work ; and it is highly improb-
able that Suetonius, il his book was written after this date, would
not have mentioned so distinguishedapersonage and so intimate
a friend as Pliny. But we know that Juvenal was still living four·

teen years later. Further, Juvenal tells us little about himself3
and he is mentioned by none of his contemporaries except

Martial. (The information gleaned from his own satires and
from Martial is considered below) The next mentioh os him
occurs in Lactantius, two hundred years later. Nor is this long

silence surprising; for classical literature came to an end with.
his death. But it is surprising that his name never occurs in
the Letters ol Pliny. These letters appeared between 97 and
110 nn, to which period Juvenal’s first book must be assigned,
and they contain many references to literary events. Yet Juvenal
is never mentioned. lt is perhaps not uncharitable to suppose
that if Juvenal had praised Pliny, the passage would have been

preserved in a letter, together with some information about the
satirist. Their silence maybe due to mutual want os sympathy;
soritis clear that Pliny belonged to the Lord chesterfields
and Sir William Temples ol literature, while Juvenal was one d
the Johnsons and Swifts.

Ibe Ancient Biographz‘es.

As we have no biography from Suetonius, we must gather
what information we can from other sources. The first ni
these consists in the anonymous biographies attached to many
of the interpolated manuscripts of Juvenal.

These Lives are very numerous: at least twelve have been
preserved. But they are generally of slight authenticity and
value: it is easy to see how this or that detail is drawn from no
other source than a passage, perhaps misunderstood, of Juvenal
himself. One Life, lately discovered, asserts that he was bom
in 5 5 nl), and gives the names of his parents; but the inserence·
to be drawn from this unsupported statement in a manuscript·
