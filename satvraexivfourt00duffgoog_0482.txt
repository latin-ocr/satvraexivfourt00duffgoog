71. mata: so Buch. aiter Paud the schoht the abl. after idoneus

atille agar, i. e. as a husbandman.

73. plurimum mtmrnarortt: a prosaic phrase: cf. Quint. v 4, a
plurimum intererit, quiret quem postulet cet. There isonly one other
elision in Juv. similar to that os plurimum here, viz. quantulum in 6,
151: see n. to Pontica 6, 661. Virgil gives himself more licence in this
point: in the Aeneid he often elides the last syll. ot' Ilium, also ol
amnium (1, 599), oi alienam (1, 667), ol audiam (4, 387), os abluam
(4, 684), and of eneam (12, 569). He also uses hiatus after a cretio
e-g. after insulae (Aen. 3, 111), and after Ilia (5, 261). 'Another device
ol Virgil’s is synizesis of such words as alvea, aureis, andfm'.

8ο. Friedl. notes that vultures really nest in rocks in spite of Juv.
and Ovid Am. i 11, ao [illa arbor] vulturis in ramis...0aa tulit. The
Roman poets in general are careless observers of such matters: thus
Martial makes the swallow collect material sor ber nest with her claws.

82. 1111111, ‘from these‚’ i.e. hare or roe.

83. lade, ‘from the nest.’ levarit: P reads levaretz it seems
probable that levavit, the reading of T, is right, as the perf. ind. is
wanted to describe the repeated action: see Madv. on Cic. de Fin. v 4¹·
