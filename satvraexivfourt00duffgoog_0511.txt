93-131. Under strcss os war arrd siege, men have kept death at hay
by cating human flesh. For such we may hane perdor and prm
but the Egyptians hane no such excuse. They are no wila and
warlike racc, from whom one magle! expect such atrocities.

93. The Vascones were a Spanish tribe: aster tbe death ol Sertorius
(nc. γι) their chief town Calagurris was besieged by the Roman army
under Afranius3 and the sufferings which they endnred from hunger
became proverbial.

94. moduxere mnne, ‘prolonged their lives!

res diversa, ‘thecaseisdifferent’r cf. 8, ²¹5·

95. numa is nent. plur: cf. discriminis ultima ιι, 55.

97, 98. ‘For the instance, now in questiones this lood (ie. human
flesh) deserves pity, inasmuch as the people 1 have just spoken ol (ie.
the Vascones)....’ The antecedent ol quadis exemplum, not huius.

There is great awkwardness in the expressiont and also the sense,
which elcut must bear, is doubtful. There are instance· in Plautus,
where sr'cut is apparently=siqurklem2 bnt they are lew and uncertain:
see Tyrrell‘s ιι. to Mil. Glor. 974. And in any case, Plautine usage
throws little light on Juv.

Bilch. explains differently: huius r'n Aegypto facinoris miserabile
exemplum usus ciborum ralis...‚ viz. ‘is an instance ol cannibalism is to
excite pity, there must be such a diet as in the case ol the Vascones!
Thus sicut secures its right meaning: hut greater difficulties are raised
lle takes cibi as nom. plur. ι how then can the verb (debet) be singular?
And would not celi require some such epithet as tales?

102. tame, ‘because ol hunger’: t'or the quantity, see n. to 6, 4²4„

¹04· ventribus is much more sorcible and pictoresque than urbr'lms,
the reading ol P, but cannot be called certain= viribus ol the inferior
Mss. is impossible.

106. noa, ‘usmoderns’z cf. nostn's 14, 323.

107. Zeno was the founder ol the Stoic philosophy, and taught that
moral virtue (honestum) was the only good, and that a man should
rather die than do wrong. But itis a remarkable laet that the Stoics

rather favoured, than condemned, the practice which Juv. is attacking.
For the evidence, see Μ. ad loc.

emmanuelem so P: quedam are Zeno and his followers. Ct'.
Sen. Epp. 70, y non omni pretio vita emenda est. The tutem urs-s„
have omma, quaedam, ‘not all things hut only sume thimeus* ἰ 'm Μ
case the subject to pretam is praecepta.
