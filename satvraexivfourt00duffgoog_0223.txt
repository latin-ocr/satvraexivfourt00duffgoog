’ leaven. This is said by the poor client to the pampered slave; he has to
pay something for the eake but is too angry to tale it. obi habeis
generally a rude form ot refusal, meaning‘I don'twant’: cf. 5, 118 libibabe
frunientune ; Semele Bere. vi a 3, 8 ‘nolo sibi babeat. quis illum rogat? ’
et omnes alios impudentis animi noces bis adstrue (which shows that sibi
babeot=nolo); Cic. ad Art. vii 11, 1 sibi babeat suam fortunam, ‘I don’t
want Caesar’s greatness'3 and Munro on Lucr.iii135. In Livy xxvi
50, sa eurum tollere oc sibi babere iussit, Scipio's refusal to accept the
money is polite, but this is exceptional. Plautus uses the words without
any sense of refusal, eg. Miles 23 me sibi habeto: egomet me ei neoneepeo
dabo. Lastly, when habe precedes tibi (eg. Catull. 1, 8), the meaning is
different.

The common explanation, that the words are addressed to the client
and that libum is understood as object os accipe, is open to two objec-
tions: (1) that the meaning of tibi liobe is ignored, (a) that fermentum
has to mean ‘cause os anger‚’ which is unexampled and here ambiguous.
Nor does the pronoun (lstud) favour this interpretation: illud (read only
by the worse mss.) would be required.

in practice they were permitted and encouraged to make any savings

runt ventre fraudato, pro capite (treedom) nunterant: seen. to l. 141.
