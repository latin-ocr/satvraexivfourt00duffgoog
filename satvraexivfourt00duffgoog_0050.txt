force and a kind of humour. But the position of this line
should be noticed. In the previous lines, the same thing has
been' already said twice, but with much less point and vigour.
This artifice is common in Juvenal. He has the practised
rhetorician’s eye for a climax3 and, sure of the effect which he
has reserved for the end, he refuses to spoil it by any premature

applause in e rhetorical schools‚ where these sententiae, as '

they wer called, were prized to excess. The thought may
someti s be a commonplace, but the form is so perfect that

familiai idea, has constantly adopted his foreign phrase. Tacitus
has a> share of this peculiar gist3 so has Quintilian ; but no
Roman writer, not even Horace himself, has left so many phrases

Europaeis, and some are habitually quoted even by those who
have never heard the name of Juvenal. Such are the lines :—

si natura negat, facit indignatio versum.
quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes?

dat veniam corvis, vexat censura columbas.

nemo repente suit turpissimus.

nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se
quam quod ridiculos homines facit.

haut facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat
res angusta domi.

plurima sunt quae
non audent homiues pe1tusa dicere laena.

rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cycno.
