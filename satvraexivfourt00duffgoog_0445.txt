NOTES. 381

trama: legend placed Medusa in Libya: the epithet is sarcastic
here, ‘the negress.’

5. The calf, reserved for Jupiter, is dragged to the altar unwillingly
by a rope. poturus is perhaps used in the sense of petulcus.

7. quippe, ‘sor': see n. to 13, 2⁶.

8. mero: the victim was dedicated, before being slain, by the
pouring over its homs, of wine, incense, and riola salsa (hence immolare).

ro. ree ampla domi: see n. to res angusta domi 6, 357.

simma ottonibus, ‘to correspond with what I feel'; see nn. to
6, 2143 15, 150.

11. ntupum must have been a familiar figure in the streets oi
Rome3 see n. to Procula 3, 203.

13. laeta, ‘rich,' ‘luxuriant,’ a constant epithet of such words as
fruges, pabula, segetes. Clitumnus is a river in Umbria, the meadows
on whose banks supplied a breed of white oxen which are repeatedly
mentioned as the choicest victims.

The animal is first called sanguis, and then cervix, much as an
elephant is called ebur l. 112: this is hardly tolerable in English, so
transl, ‘whose blood (ie. race) proclaims the rich pastures of Clitumnus,
and whose neck needs a tall sacrificer to strike the blow.’

For victims so described, cs. Ovid Fasti iv 415 apta iugo ceruix nou
est ferienda securi ; Stat. Theb. iv 446 quaecunque gregum pulcherrima
cervix, Ι ducitur3 ibid. xi 284 hostria, nate, iaces cau mutus et c grege
sanguis. (It seems as it sanguis was used in the sense ol victima.)

14. The process ot slaughtering is described by Seneca, Dial. ί 6, 8
tenui ferro commissura cervicis abrumpitur, et cum articulus ille qui
caput collumque committit inctsm est, tauta illa moles corruit. Hence
grandi does not mean that the man must be strong, but tall enough to
reach up to the animal’s neck.

ministro: th'e priest‘s attendants are properly called popae.

16. incolumem, ‘alive'

¹9· nube nnc: cf. C. Bronte, Shirley p. 336 ‘there is only one
cloud in the sky3 but it curtains it from pole to pole.’

ar. acumina, ‘thunderstruck' only in the metaphorical sense: cs.
Seneca quoted on 7, 67.

nullum conferri etc: cf. 14, 19 which shows that conferri has here
the sense of comparari ς so 13, 144

aa. wells ardentibus, ‘a fire at sea-⁵

23. poetica...t0mm‚ ‘a sturm 'in a poem'x so sema &Q
oi a mrmimm naufragium, ‘a slirpwreclr ou the stage* &Dm-'⁸⁸³ Ἃ ‘³'
