might be offended at the statement that the Circus could hold it all.

Under Vespasian the Circus held s5o,ooo spectators3 it was enlarged by
Trajan, and in the 4th century 385,000 persons found accommodatiori.
The population oi Rome cannot be certainly estimated3 Friedlhnderis
of opinion, judging partly by the number oi those who received distri-
butions of corn, that it was between one million and a half and two
milliens, at the end oi the first century.

197· capit, ‘holds’: non capere is commonet: cf. 1. 171.

fragor aurem permut: cf. Sen. Epp. 83, 7 ecce circensium obstrepit
clanwr. We do not know where Juv.'s house was3 but it need not
have been very near the Circus, in order to hear the noise.

198. qnoapanm, ‘from which I infer the success oi the green
jacket’ The horses and drivers in the Circus were provided by wealthy
campanies (factthncs), with whom the munerarius, whether praetor or
consul, had to make a contract. There were four factiones, each
possessing its own stud and naming-stades, and also a colour, which
was displayed on the chariot and person of the driver. They competed
against one another, one chariot os each colour taking part in each tace·
The colours were red (messala, sc. factio), white (alba), green (prasina),
and blue (veneta). Domitian’s attempt to add agold anda purple
colour was abortive. By degrees the red and white became less
important; and the real struggle lay between the blue and the green.
ihc partisanslrip os the populace was incredibly enthusiastic: see n. to
5, 143² at Constantinople in 532 mn. a riot arose in this way which cost
3o,ooo lives. The Christian converts, when rebuked by their pastors
sor their excessive interest in the competition, pleaded in excuse that
Elijah had gone up to heaven in a chariot! For details of the taces see
n. to 3, 223.

The word generally means ‘result,’ whether favourable or not.

vindis...pannt: the pannus (the word is constantly used in this
connexion) is the tunic ol the aurzga, as Pliny shows, Epp. ix 6 favent
panno, pannum amant;...tanta gratiis, tanta auctoritas in una vilissima
tunica. The colour of this factio is elsewhere usually called prasinus,
lit. leel-coloured.

199. attonitam, ‘strichen‘z cf. 4, 77: a stronger word than maestam:
cf. Sen. Dial. xi 15, 5 non solum maestum sedetiam attonitum.
