ment immediately preceding, and when it applies, as here, to the
whole clause and not to any one word in it ς seen. to 13, 183. ila
(very common in Plautus), usque ea, is, lam, and lantum are used in the
same way at the beginning of a sentence. ⁴

This absolute use of adea is peculiar to silverage Latin and occurs
constantly in Livy and Tacitus. Iu classical Latin it has two uses:
(1) as an enclitic, following pronouns etc.; (a) to mark a gradation,
when it is followed by ut.

278. Milton, P. l.. Bk. i, speaks of ruffians of this kind whom
he may have met himself:

And when night
· Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sous
0f Belial, flown with insolence and wine.

In the beginning of the 18th century London was infested by
street ruffians, known by the name of Mohocks (ie. sauages): “Did
Ι tell you of a race of takes called the Mohocks that play the devil
about this town every night, slit people’s noses, and bid them etc. ?''
Swift’s Journal la Stella, March 8, 1711-12.

perulam, ‘violent’ ‘brutal.' ΤΙιε word is only a little less strong
than furiosus (1. 291), as may be seen from Cic. Brutus 241 fervida
