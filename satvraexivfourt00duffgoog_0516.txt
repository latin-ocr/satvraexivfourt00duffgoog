452 JUVENAL, xv.

159. iam, ‘nowadays’: the Creator’s intentions have been frustrated

by our wickedness.
Moralists in all ages have pointed to the behaviour oi animals to

their own kind as an example to man; but the facts are not quite as the
moralists have stated them.

160. Two constructions are possible: (ι) ‘the wild beast, alilre in
spots, spares its kin’3 (a) ‘a wild beast of the same kind spares
kindred spots‚’ ie. aspotted creature of its lind. of these the first is
preferred by Friedl., but the second seems more natural and more like
Juv. The meaningis the same in either case—that panther will not prey
on panther.

165. incude produxiseo=procudztse‚ which Lucr. (v 1265) uses ior
working metal into swords on an auvil.

166. parum eet, ie. they are not content with killing, but must
also eat, their victims.

eum, ‘though’

167. murrae, meula, and vomer all occur 3, 3¹1· The state·
ment sounds conventional and untrue when compared with Lucretius'
picture oi primitive maur he says thet men first fought with teeth aud
nails, or stones (domestica tela 1. 64) and pieces os wood, and then with
swords as soon as they discovered the use of metal (v 1283-1296).

168. gledioe extendere, ‘to forge long swords’: ci. Lucan iv 417
carinas Ι extendunt (they build long keels).

169. aspicimur, ‘sor we see’

171· crediderint: the 1st pers. sing. regularly means ‘1 arn
inclined to believe': but here the subj. seems not to be potential but
consecutive aiter qui (=tales ut) which is to be supplied from quorum:
ihc omission os a repeated relative pronoun is common in Latin: see n.
to 11, ²5·

174. tamquam homine: ci. 14, 98.

Pythagoras ate no flesh but only vegetables, and not every lrind oi
vegetable: beans in particular were excluded from his diet, though there
is some uncertainty as to his reasons: see n. to 3, 229, and cs. 'Hor
Sat. ii 6, 63sal1a Pythagvrae cognata with Palmer’s n.
