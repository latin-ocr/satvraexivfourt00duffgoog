xlvi INTRODUCTION.

the concluding formula (explicit liber quintus) is not found,
though there is room for it and it is appended to all the other

books. The appearance of the MS. proves that it is mutilated,
and once contained more than it does now ; no one who has
held it in his hand can doubt thie, says Biicheler. But none of
the other Mss. give any indication of a loss: they subjoin the
usual formula after 1. 60, as is the satire and book had come
to their natural conclusion. This is another proof of the unique
value of P.

Lastly, good spelling is a sure sign of a good Ms.; and the
spelling of P is generally good and classical. Biicheler notes,
forits rarity‚ a single instance of the spelling salatia for salacia.
The other Mss. are full of barbarous spellings, especially in
proper names, compared with which salatia is a venial offence.

lt was said above that P is the only entire Ms. which
represents the better tradition of the text. But there are
various fragments which belong to the same class. Of these
the Florilegium of St Gall has already been mentioned. At
Aarau live leaves of a similarius. with Scholia have been
found: they had been-used to bind other books: and Scholia
like those of P are preserved at St Gall, though the Ms. from
which they were copied, is no longer extant. ,

With these exceptions, all the ΜΒ. authority for Juvenal's
text belongs to the interpolated class. All these Mss. contain a
large number, not of mere blandem, but of interpolations and
false readings. ln many cases, these give a sufficiently good
sense; but the readings peculiar to P, and the other marks of
superiority already mentioned, have convinced all scholars that
the text of P must be preferred in every case where it is not
debarred by the sense. Thus in Sat. ι, 143 crudus (so P) and
crudum (so ω) both give good sense3 yet the first must be
preferred. On the other hand there are not a few cases where
the reading of ω must be preferred on grounds of meaning or
language. Thus in Sat. 3, 61 all editors read, with ω, quota
partia faecis Achaei, where P has Achaeae. It is certain that a
nominative is wanted3 so that, is Achaeae is an adj. agreeing
with faeere, it is wrong. Yet it is possible that Achaeae stands
