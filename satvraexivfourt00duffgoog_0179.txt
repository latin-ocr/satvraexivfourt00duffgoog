SATIRE Ι.
ou rus Rsnsous son wmmuc snmus

‘The first satire is a series oi incoherent complaints....A married im·
potent, an athletic lady, a barber rich enough to challenge the fortunes
oi all the patricians: the Egyptian Crispinus with his ring, the lawyer
Matho in his litter: the iniamous will-hunter, the robber os his ward,
the plunderer of the provincesr the pandet husband, the low-bom
spendthriit, the iorger, the poisone13 all these are hurried together in
no intelligible order, and with the same introductory cum horfiat, and
the same conclusion in several variations, non scribam saturam? Then
at l, 81 the satire seems to open again and promise a description os
various vices3 but instead oi this we have an elaborate complaint, ex-
tending over many lines, of the poverty of the nobility, with a description
os the hardships oi a client. ...The ill-proportioned piece concludes with
a promise to write against the dead) Nettleship‚ Journ. of Phil. xvi p. 62.

1—21. I have to listen to so much phaley, epic and elegy, comedy and
tragedy, recited without mercy by our authors, that I have deter-
mined to commence poet too. I have had the sanie edueation as they
have. And why I choose satire in preference to other styles‚ I will
explain, if I can get a quiet hearing.
