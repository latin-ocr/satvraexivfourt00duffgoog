127, 128. The epithets parvula and brevibus are meant to suggest
the feeble powers of the Egyptians. For testas, seen. to 14, 311:
testae is gen„ govemed by remis· The want ol wood forced them to
make boats of unusual materiale.

131—174. Man is distinguished srom animala ty tlte power to werp:
pity is tlte noblest manifestatian os human nature, and hunran
· civa'lasati'on is based upon synapatlty. But man lias fallen until
lae is coen laver tlran tlte animals: liam do not prey on lions, but

man attacks tis fellaw and even devours him.

133. haec, ‘this‚‘ ie. ‘sympathy,' relers to mollissima corda: ‘ol all
our feelings sympathy is the noblest.’

¹34· lubet: the subject is natura. The constr. is, natura iubet nas
plorare squalorem amici causam diceritis et rei ς but there is some objec-
tion to this, as causam dicentis and rai are identical in meaning3
hence Kiaer's somewhat improbable conjecture, squalorem atque rei,
by which rei becomes a noun and is distinct from amici.

135. squalorem refers especially to the untrimmed beard and hair
by which men on trial endeavoured to excite pity: ci. Mart. ii 24, 1 si det
iniqua tibi tn'stem fortuna reatum, Ι squalidus haerebo pallidiorque rao.

ad lura, ‘into court ‘: generally in ius: ci. 10, 87.

have robbed him olbis property‚'brings them into court: circumscriptio
is used of legal chicane of all kinds.

137. incerta, i.e. it is difficult to tell whether he is a b0y ora
girl: Roman boys wore their hair long and are hence called capillati
(Mart. x 62, a), and cirrhati (id. ix 29, 7): they must not be confused
with the class ol slaves to whom the same names were given.

138. adultae, ie. nubilis, death at that age being considered espe-
cially tragic: cf. Lucretius quoted on 12, 118.

140. minor igno rogi, ‘too small lor the lunera] fire': it was the
custom, as still among llindus, to bury, not to burn, infants: cs. Pliny
Nat. Hist. vii 72 hantinem prius quam genito dente nemori mos
gentium nan est. Cremution, though general, was not universal at
Rome even ior adults: thus it is mentioned that Sulla was the first
member of the gens Cornelia to be burnt: all before him had been
buried.

For the abl.‚ see n. to 4, 66. raca-ugnus muna, ‘worthy ol the

mystic torch,’ i.e. worthy to bear a partin mehtysxeries ol Demeter
