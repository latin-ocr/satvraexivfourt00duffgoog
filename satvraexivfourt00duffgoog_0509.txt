NOTES. 445

63. inclinatis (‘back·bent’) martin is to be taken with torquere,
not with quaesita.

64. torquere: see n. to 6, 449. mortim, ‘ready-made)

65. The reference is to the heroes of Homer and Virgil‚ who use
huge stenes as missiles in war: cl. Il. xii 380, v 302 ; Aen. xii 896.

nae, ‘but not’ queue is object oi torquebant understood

69. In each oi the above cases, Homer, enlarging on the siae of the
moue, says that his own generation (otor uir βροτοί etat) could not
rival the hero’s seat: and to this Juv. is alluding satirically. The belief
that the stature and strength of the race has been gradually diminishing‚
was general in antiquity‚ and stoutly maintained by lord Monboddo at ·
the end ol last century. “Ah, doctor,'‘ he said to Johnson, “poor
creatures are we of this eighteenth century3 our fathers were better
men than we !'' Johnson replica, “ Oh no, my lord; we are quite as
strong as our foresathers aud a great deal-wiser.” On the theory ol the
gradual degradation, both physical and moral, of mankind, De Quiucey
remarks: “as men ought physically to have dwindled long ago into
pygmies, so, on the other hand, mornlly they must by this time have
lest Sodom and Gomorrah lar behind. What a strange animal must
man upon this scheme offer to our contemplation: shrinlring in siae, by
graduated process, through every century, until at last he would not
rise an inch from the ground3 and on the other hand, as regards
villainy, towering ever more and more up to the heavens. What a
dwarf l what a giant! Why the very crows would combine to destroy
such a little monster ’' (Collectcd Writings 1 p. 97).

71. He laughs at meu,because theyarepygmies(cl.r3,170—173)‚
and hates them because they are scoundrels.

72. a mvaueuu, ‘at'ter the digression' about the size os the
stones: the apology is less necessary here than in many other places
where it does not occur.

73. aucti, sc. sunt3 the apodosis begins at pars.

74 pugnam murare, ‘to renew the battle’: see n. to 8, 158.

75. The tiss. are in great contiuiou here. In P all is erased alter
praestant: other uss. have stega and various endings such as praestant·
ibus amathus instant, or praestant instantibus orbes. The emendation
given iu the text is highly probable.

rugae is dat. alter terga praestant: cf. Propert. iv (v) a, 54 turpi
terga Missa fugae with Postgate’s note: terga dare *nas tue sam
