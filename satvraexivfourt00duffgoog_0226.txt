162 Juvenal, 111.

may be observed: (r) that the contractiori ἒ may have arisen frama
repetition of the last letter of anseranum (a) thatin any ras. provided
with glosses, est would certainly be supplied over the line and may have
found its way thence into the text.

211. bospitio mamque, ‘with the shelter of a roof.¹

nra. Asturici, a noble. ‘l'he matrons and aristocrats put on
mourning as if for a public calamity; there is a iustitium in the
law-courts. For mater, cf. 8, 2673 for pullati, 10, 245.

213. maeri...praotor‚ ‘the magistrate postpones the buil-bonde?
i.e. adjoums the business and remands the cases before him.

214. odimus, ‘express our hatred of,’ almost ‘curse’: see n. to 7, 35.

215. ardetscnfamus. Asturicuscanhardlybe the subject; ultimus
ardebit (l. 201) is not analogous.

et serves as a kind of temporal particle ; cf. the use of nal in Greek.
The parataxis is quite possible, though less common, in English.

marmora, ‘marble‚’ to build a new house; to translate ‘statues’
anticipates what is coming.

216. conferat inpensas is usually explained ‘to contribute money¹;
but this is unsatisfactory, as impensae is ‘expenditure’ not ‘money':
impensis would be needed to give a suitable meaning. Perhaps
impensae is used in the sense of ‘mate1·ials’; in Frontinus, a con·
temporary of Juv., de Aquis 124 impensa evidently means ‘material’
for the repair of aqueducts and is explained (c. 125) by terra, limus,
lapides, testa (bricks), harena, ligna ceteraque quibus ad eam rem opus
esset; cf. also Amm. Marcell. xxvii 3, ιο aedificia em'gere exumbres ruva,
..uun ex titulis solitis parari iubebat irrepensas, sed, siferrnm quaerebatur
aut plumbum aut aes ant quicquam simile, apparitores iume'llebuntnr,
qui velut exsteriles diversa raperent, where impensae is explained by
plumbum, aes, serrum etc. This meaning suits the passage well, coming
just after marmora donet.

217. Euphranor was a statuary and painter at Athens about
uc. 3363 Polycleitus, a still more famous sculptor, flourished a century
earlier; his chief work was the ivory and gold statue of Hera at Argos.

218. haec, ‘another, a lady.’ P and the Scholiast agree in this
reading; phaecasiatarum, ‘slippered,' is the ingenious conjecture of

ι Roth, based on ficariauarnm of the inferior mss, but there is no
evidence that gods were represented with this shoe. The ornamenta
dem are the statues which used to adom the temples in Asia: cf.

Livy mi 30, 9 dis ipsis oruanrnetisque eorum ablutis, nihil relictam
&trecasas esse.
