The reading in the text is that os P which Buch. keeps and explains
thus: debet poenas quascumque metuit ex ira mariti. The Latin is
doubtful (eg. the sense of the gen. marui and the order ol words), and
the phrase excessively awkward. Rigalt's iratis maritis is too bold;
Madvig's emendation, ira sibi, is the simplest which gives a good sense:
the injured husband’s anger is not satisfied until it has exacted sufficient
punishment.
