214 JUVENAL, VI.

18. umbus: the dat. after timere is good and classical, eg. Virg.
Aen. ii 729 comitique onerique timentem3 but the addition of the aee.
(furem) makes the constr. a rare one3 for an instance, cf. Quint. iv 1, 9
iudex libentissime patronum audit quem iustitiae suae minime uteret.
In Mart. i 82, 7 domiuo nihil timebat, the acc. is adverbial.

aperio, ‘unwalled' viveret: quisque is to be supplied from nemo,
as subject: so Hor. Sat. i 1, 1 where see Palmer's note.

19. Astraea, daughter of Zeus, was the last of the immortals to
leave the earth when it became too wicked for herr cf. Ovid Met. i 149
caede madentes, Ι ultima caelestum, terras Astraea reliquit.

Hence ‘Astraea Redux’ (=the return of the Golden Age), the
heading of a chapter in Carlyle’s Freuch Revolute'ou.

ro. heo, ie. Pudicitia. duae sorores, ‘the two sisters.’ ,

nr. annom etvetus, ‘of ancient date and of long standing';
there is no tautology‚ as the first adj. indicates the point of time when
the practice began, and the second, the period of time during which it
has been kept up3 cf. 15, 33 3 Plaut. Miles 751 quin tu istane orationem¹
hinc veterem atque antiquam uniones?

genium contemnere runt, ‘to disregard the deity of the marriage-
bed’: the fulcrum corresponds to the head of a modern sofa;
it is the end of the trane-work on which the pillows of a couch were
placed; some specimens are extant, and these usually terminate in an
ass’s head of bronze: cf. 11, 96 foll. : lower down on the fulcrum, there
isgenerally a round boss of metal carrying a bust of a Genius or some
god, who is supposed by Juv. to protect the inviolability of wedlock.

This passage was first explained by Professor Anderson (Closs.
Rev. 111 p. 322, where a good illustration will be found). fulcrum was
before supposed to mean the foot of the couch, that on which the
couch rests; it really means the top of the conch, that on which a
sleeper rests his head.

²3· almon: see n. to 1, 75. mox, ‘afterwards'; the regular
meaning of the word in silver Latin.

24. ‘But the silver age. ...’ This age began with the expulsion of
Saturn 3 it was followed by the iton age, which was even more wicked,
though in this one respect it had nothing to leam. The inappropriate
plural saeuela is due to metrical convenience; see n. to 4, 68. For
ages named after metals, seen. to 13, 28.

25. oonventttm...ttponeelle‚ ‘a contract and agreement and be·

notham cenventus is used metri causa for conventio, hixstaaer aad
