misfortune, and to ln’ng oneself intonatice1.’ It is certain that
Pliny thought all these motives creditable, as the main object of
his letters, which were carefnlly edited before publication, is to
put his own conduct in a favourable light. Pliny was a wealthy
senator and a distinguished pleader; Juvenal seems to have
been needy and obscure. Yet the same motives may well have
inspired Juvenal's fourth satire and the eloquent harangue which
Pliny hurled across the Senam-house against a foeno longer to
be feared‚ and which he afterwards published with additions².
That satire, under such circumstances, must fall very flat, is true
, of satire generally; but it is not true of Juvenal: we read him
still.

But, if Juvenal was not a hero, it by no means follows that
he was dishonest and insincere. We shall understand him
best if we believe that his eye is fixed throughout on the reign of
Domitian, and the horrors, political and social, which he must,
himself have witnessed when he was of full age to appreciate
them. Like Tacitus and Pliny, he had to hide his feelings at -
the time and play at oratory in the schools ; but all the while he
was sharpening his weapons, and when freedom of speech and
better government returned in the time of Trajan, his resentment
rushed forth all the hotter for its long suppression. He speaks
of Domitian just as Tacitus does in the Agricola (98 mn.) and
Pliny in the Panegyricus (100 h.D.): only they admit that with
Trajan a better era began. But Juvenal never once acknow·
ledges the better times, but for which he could never have
written with such freedom. Was his anger too hot? or was the
rhetorician determined not to relieve the gloom of his picture?

We have said that society at Rome was exceedingly corrupt,
and we admit that Juvenal’s pictures of private morality are
substantially true; yet exception must be taken to the principle

' on which he distributes his censures. His hottest wrath seems
