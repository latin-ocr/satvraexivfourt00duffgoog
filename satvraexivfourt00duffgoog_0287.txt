it was osten called partiare Argonautarum, as the porticus Pollae,
erected by Agrippa‘s sister, Polla Vipsania, was known sor similar
reasons as the portabas Europae (cf. Mart. iii ao, 123 xi 1, ιη
ii 14, 15-18). Jason would certainly be a· prominent figure in the
irescoes: he is called mercator sarcastically‚ because of the purpose os
his voyage; the Argonautae are degraded to nautae.

The Saturnalia and Sigillaria are coupled in a letter os Tiberius
quoted by Suet. Claud. 5: when Claudius, then a young man of little
promise, pressed his uncle to make him consul, Tiberius id solum
codicillis rescn‘pslt quadraginta aureos in Saturnalia et Sigillaria
mr‘sissc ei, a present as uncomplimentary as the tennis-baiis sent to
Henry V by the Dauphin.

154. umam: i.e. the heroes on board the Argo carried weapons
and were not dressed like ordinary sailors: a ship is osten said to have
amna (or arutanrenta) but sailors had none: ci. Ovid Fusa ii ιοι quid
tibi cum gladio? dubiam regu, nauita, pinum.

155. tolluntur, sc. a Bibula, ‘she carries off! mystalllna are
vases made, not of glass, but oi rock·crystal; their excellence consisted
in having no flaw (vilmar) in the substance; cf. Mart. ix 59, 13 turbata
breui questus crystallina vitm iii 82, 25 crystallinisquc myrrhiuisqru
propinate It was sor breaking a vase oi this kind that one of his slaves
was sentenced by Vedius Pollio to be thrown as food to his pet
lampreys; Augustus, who was dining with Pollio at the time, ordered
all the crystallina to be broken in his presence and the ish-pond to be
filled up (Sen. Dial. v 40, a).

156. myrrhina or murrea are constantly mentioned in ancient
writers together with crystallina as vases oi great value. But no
specimen is now extant, and there has been much controversy as
to what substance is meant by ucurra. One fact is clear from the
ancient authorities (cs. esp. Pliny Nat. Hist. xxxvii 204) that murra
was a mineral dug out oi the earth, not an artificially manufactured
porcelain. Some good authorities hold that murra was ‘a variety os
agate, containing shades osred and purple.' The mineral was not
transparent and was very fragile.

Berenices: this Jewish princess played a part, somewhat like
Cleopatra’s, in Roman history. As a young widow she lived long with
her brother, King Agrippa II, and it was believed she had incestuous
relations with him (cf. incestae l. 15813 Paul deiended inmanissime
them at Caesarea 62 aa). (Acts 25 and abl. litonum eommaxxb‘ms„
