83-130. I bid my slaves make all preparatione for the sacn'ch05 the's
completed, I will make offlro'ngs to my household gods as well, anal
decorate my house. Nor haue these reyoiee'ngs any interested mote'ue‚·
Catullus has children, so that I cannot expect to inhere't from ht'm.
As a rulo it is only the childless who have sseeh attentshns pald
them ,· no sacn'fice is too costly for the greedy will-hunters to offer, ij
a childless rich man is even slightly s'll. If elephants were to be
bought, they would not hesitate to sacnfice one, or a slave, or enen,
like Agamemnon, a daughter. A legaey e's certainly worth more
anm'ety than a fleet of a thousand ships. For the rich man may

. recover, ana', e'n gratitudo for the's worederyiel devotion, may make
the soen'ficer ofa daughter his sole hee'r. Long life and great wealth
to the will-hunterl and may he love none, and none love him!

83. paen, ‘slaves’: so l. ιη.

Επεαῑε...ῐενθιιῦοε, ‘with reserent lips and hearts’: a sacrifice was
commonly preceded by the injunction favete linguis (εεύφημεῖτε)ι Seu.
Dial- vii 26, 7 says that this was a command, not sor words of good
omen, but sor silence, ut rite peragi possit sacrum nulla voce mala
obstrepente.

84. delubris are the shrines of the three deities on the Capitol,
in iront of which the three altars of turi (l. 85) are erected: see n, to
l. o. ferrals the same as mola salsa: it was sprinkled over thc victim's
head, the altar, and the sacrificial knives.

86. sequar,i.e.1 will follow you to the Capitol where the altars
are erected and duly perform the more important (quod praestat) sacri·
lice, then returning home lor the lesser rites.

praestat: this absolute, personal use oi praestare is rare: it occurs
in a letter of Asinius Pollio to Cicero: Cic. ad Fam. x 3²· 4 sed
a'e illo plura coram: nunc, quod praestat, quid me velent facere,
constituite.

87. octonae, ‘wreaths’3 serta above are ‘festoons’x cf. 9, 137 o
parvi nostn'que Lares, qnos tnre minuto Ι aut farre aut tenni soleo
exorare cororso.

88. cera: images and busts of wax, especially ol the dead, are
constantly mentioned; but it is pointed out that such a material is
unsuitable for the Lares which stood before a lire. M. shows that wax
was used as a varnish, and the Schol.’s explanation (obsecrata signa
dorum) seems to point to this. 'lhe wax ‘ts called fragilis (crumbling),

bemuse it must be melted lor this purpose.
