gave directions that for the next twelve years there should be no leap-
year. On this occasion he named Sextilis after himself, preferring it, as
the date of his first consulate and chief victories, to September in which
he was born: cf. Suet. Aug. 31.

The terror: of the capital :each their climax in the recitations of
poets. All the literature of the time, esp. Pliny’s letters and Martial’s
epigrama shows what a nuisance the verse-writer had become, and
what immense demands he made on the time and patience of his
friends whom he invited (corrogabat) to hear him read his own verses.

ιο. Umbricius' furniture is not bullry and goes¹ into one cart: itis
carried to the gate by his slaves, carts not being allowed in the streets
by day: see n. tol. 236.

11. arcus madidamque capenam: the porta Capena was a southern
gate in the Servian wall, by which thecia Appia led to Capua. Over
the gate passed an aqueduct‚ a branch of the aqua Marcia, a chief
source of the Roman water-supply. Drops of water oozed through the
channel of the aqueduct down into the road below: cf. Mart. iii 47, r
Capetus grandi porta qua pluit gutta.

ra. htc ublis used here, as often, especially by Ovid, for ubi, just
as id quod is used for quod: eg. Ovid Fast. ii 193 :dibus agrestis seruant

here is illuc understood, which is resumed at in vallem Egeriae l. 17.

in which case ubi must be separated by a comma from hic.

nocturnae, ‘by night': time is often expressed in Latin and Greek
by an adi, where English prefers an adverbial phrase: eg. vespertinus
petendum, δωδεκαταῖος ἀνεβίωε see n. to 1, 28.

constituebat amteae, ‘used to hold assignations with his mistress’3
purposely contemptuous3 see n. to r, rr: Ovid (Fast. iv 669) and Livy
(i ar, 3) call Egeria the coniunx of Numa. For constitucre in this sense
(but without dat), cf. 6, 487. The legend, which Juv. is ridiculing‚ told
that Numa learned his laws by divine communication from the nymph
Egeria by night: cf. Livy i 19, 4, who suggests that Numa invented the
story to give sanction to his enactments.
