004. The retiarius had for antagonist a secutor, whom he en·
deavoured first to entangle in his net and then to despateh with his
trident and dagger.

005. spectacula, ie. the spectators' scats: cf. 6, 61; Livy xlv 1, 0

suga mediam gladiator harenam. agnoscendus, ‘recognisable'z iu

Cicero agnoscendus est always means debet agnosci, never potest agnosci:
this use 01 the gerundivo (eg. videndus, ‘visible') begins with Ovid,
eg. Trist. iii 4, 56: see Madv. on Cic. da Fin. i 6.

007, 008. ‘Let us be convinced, since the golden cord stretehes
from the throat 01 the tunic, and shoots out from the long shoulder-
guard.' Some edd. put the comma aster 111111000; but it is the golden
spira, not the tunic, which forces the spectator to admit the painful fact.
For the tunica 01 the retiarius, cl. 0, 143 quoted above, and Suet.

aurea: a prool' that here is no common gladiator.

208. porrigat: some understand tunica as subject, but the verb
required in that case would surely be demittam the subject is 00110, the
coiled rope or cord by means 01 which the net was thrown and recovered:

galerus is usually a head-covering worn as disguise: cf. 6, 100 crinon
abscondente galero, and Suet. quoted on 1. 158. The context shows this
meaning to be impossible here, as Gracchus is determined to be recog·
nised. Hence an explanation given hythe Schol. is generally accepted:
galmas ast unuro impositus gladiatoris. For it is known that 0 high
guard 01 leatber 0111101οΙ waswom on the 1011 shoulder by the retiarius

out likeawing3 hence longo. Agood figure willbelound in Baumeister's
Dcnkmir'ler p. 0097. This passage seems to show that the spira was
attached to the galerus: neither net nor spira appears in the figure
referred to: they are seldom represented in any work 01 011.

010. The antagonist 01 the retortus, called 00011101, was armed
