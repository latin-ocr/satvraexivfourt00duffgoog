278 JUVENAL, vrr.

intactam, ‘virgin’ ; ci. Mart. iou, 7uirginispater chartae: a double
meaning is intended, as it Paris were a leno.

Paridi: ci. 6, 873 this was a famous dancer (pantomimus) of
Domitian's time, who was put to death in 83 aa). ior an intrigue
with the empress, Domitia, Martial wrote an epitaph for him (xi 13).
lt seems to have been customary for artists to take the name oi some
famous predecessor: the chiet pantomimus oi Nero's reign, exeeuted
in 67 nm, was also called Paris 3 aad there were others oi the same
name in the next century.

The art ol the pantomimus consisted entirely in dramatic gesticula-
tion. The subjecte oi the sabatae solticac were generally taken from
mythology, eg. the murder oi Pentheus by his mother. A large chorus,
accompanied by aa orchestra, sang the fabula, which consisted osa string
oi lyric odes, dealing with the most important episodes of the story.
Meanwhile, the pantomimus, alone upon the stage, represented the
action by gesticulation, without uttering a word. This was by far the
most popular spectacla in theatres ot the Roman empire. Even parts
ot the Aeneid were so represented: cf. Suet. Nero 54 uouerat...proditn-
rum se...lu'stoionem (asa dancer) saltaturumque Vergili Turnum. It is
difficult tor us to realise the power of expression shown by the best
pantomimi: cf. Quint. xi 3, 66 saltatio frequenter sine voca intellegitur:
Tacitus (Dal. 26) mentions as aphrase oi the time that histriones are
said dt'sa'ta saltare. It must be remembered that, in ancient dancing,
the arms were more important than the legs.

88, 89. ‘Paris bestows on many rank in the army as well, and puts,
lor six months’ service, the ring round poets' fingers.’ All the officere
of the legion, called tribuni, received the privileges os equestrian rank3
and Claudius instituted a custom of making sinecure appointments to
the tribunate, in order that the holder might become an eques, without
any military service: cf. Suet. Claud. a 5 instituit...imaginariae militiae
mnus, quod uocatur supro munierum, quo absentasti titulo tenus flengn-
rentur. A six months tenure oi the rank was sufficient to ennoble the
holder: ci. Pliny Epp. iv 4 (to Sosius Senecio) hunc rogo semestri tribn-
notu spleniaiiiorom...facrirs. Martial became an eques by this back-door,
probably by gift oi Titus: cf. Mart. iii 95, 9 uidit me Roma tribunum, Ι
et sedeo qua te suscitat Oceanus (ie. I can sit undisturbed in the knights'
scats in the theatre). Hence aarum semenstrozaurum semenstrium
urbanorum and means ‘knighthood gained hya command for six

orontis!

These appointments were nominally conlerred by the emnem
