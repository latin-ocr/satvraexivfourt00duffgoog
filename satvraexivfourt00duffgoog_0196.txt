147. moribus, ‘vices’

148. mores, ‘posterity,’ less common than maiores, ‘ancestors’

149. omne...stetlt, ‘vice always stands above a sheer descent,’ and
therefore soon reaches its extreme point; hence there is no lower depth
left for our posterity. The old interpretation (‘every vice has settled at
its zenith') is untenable, because in praecipiti regularly suggests the
danger of falling, not height alonez cf. Seu. Epp. 23, 6 in prac-
cipiti voluptas stat,⁴ ad dolorem vergit nisi niodum tenuit (Mada).
usserman, in a critical condition, is said c'n praecipiti esso. (This
explanation I owe to Mr H. Richards: see Classical Revicro, vol. vi
n· us)

stetit is thus a gnomic aorist.

utere velle: addressed by the poet to himself ς the metaphor is
continued in the following verse. ,

150. usos panda sinus: a common metaphor: cf. Pliny Epp. viii
4', 5 (toa friend intending to write a history of Trajan's campaigns in
Dacia) imncicterudcntcc pandcvcla, ac, siquando olias, toto ingenio velere.

dices: so Pe for the fut., cf. 12, 1253 14, 295. forsitan ought
to take the subj. as much as laudacia an, and does so in correct prose3
when it takes the ind., it is regarded as a simple adverb.

Recent edd. read dicas with theinferior uss: and the ind. of the
and person is unusual, but the fact that the verb comes first is important.

There follows a dialogue between the poet and an imaginary friend,
in the ancient fashion of satura (Introd. p. xxxi).

151. materiam the last syllable is not elided. This and similar
instances of hiatus are common in Juv. ; see n. to ιο, 281.

153, 154. The name Mucius shows that Juvenal is thinking of his
predecessor Lucilius, who attacked P. Mucius Scaevola: cf. Pers. 1, 114
secuit Lucilius urbem, lte Lupe, te illuri. lt has been suggested that
cuius...nouccn is a quotation from Lucil.; if so, it is not a verbal

quotation, as audeo could not scan as a dactyl in a writer of that

time: see n. on ergt l. 3.
culus...nomen is taken by some editors as a relative ¹clause, not as

a question, the antecedent of cuciis being sincplicitos3 in that case, the
words belong, not to Juv. but to his interlocutor. But the clause seems
to have more force as a question.

155. pone rteemnums in all languages, an imperat. sometimes
