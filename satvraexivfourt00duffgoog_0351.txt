¹51· One of the stock-exercises in the schools was to deliver
invectives against tyrants or panegyrica upon tyrannicides. It might
be supposed that the imperial government would not approve of this
practice as a regular part of education3 but the tyrant of the schools
was too fantastic aud unreal a creation to be taken seriously.

numerosa, ‘crowded'; ci. ιο, 105: in classical Latin ‘melodicus’:
cs. Ovid T rist. iv ro, 49 (where he is speaking of the great poets os his
youth) tenuit nostros numerosus Horatius aures.

152. The meaning ol the l. cannot be positively fixed, lor want of
exact knowledge of the rontine followed in such a class. satiens is
probably masculine, ‘a pupil’ being understood as subject. Some of
the less advanced students read their speeches without standing3 others,
more experienced, stand up to declaim; but all repeat precisely the same
arguments, while ‘killing their tyrant.'

153. perferat, ‘will rehearse'; cf. 6, 392· cantabit: this word,
like decantare, suggests trite repetition.

veralbua, ‘lines’ of prose as well as poetry ; cs. Pliny Epp. iii 5, ra
(os his uncle) tuemini quendam ex amicis, eune lector quaedam perperam
pronuntinsset, revocasse et repeti coegisse, truie avunculum neeum dixisse
‘intellexeras nempe? ’ cum ille astitisset, ‘eur ergo revocabas? decem
onrplius versus trac tuo interpellatione perdidimus.

154. “Till, like hash'd cabbage served with each repast,

The repetition kills the wretch at last.’' Gifford.

The stale repetition is more fatal to the teacher than to the tyrants.
crambe repanmtoloxpaota: the Scholiast quotes a proverb, δὶς
rpdyrpn θάνατος.

¹55· color, ‘line ol delence'3 see n. to 6, 280. causae genus:
cl. Quint. iii 9, 6 sedante omneis intueri oportet, quoo' sit genus causae.
summa quaestio, ‘the cardinal point of a cause,’ called also hy Quint.
caasaecardo (v 12, 33 xii 8, a).

156. cirenae, ‘from the opposite side'3 cf. 13, 136. Quint. uses
exparte adversa (ii 4, 28), and ex diverso (v 13, 1) in this sense. torte
seems weak but has better authority than a porte. A refutation of the
arguments which the adversary is likely to use (occupatio), occurs
commonly in ancient speeches: cf. Quint. v 13, 44 ridiculum est... prius
cogitare quid responderi quom quid ex de'oerso diei possit. For the
metaphor os sagittae, cf. tela quoted on l. 123.

157. Ovid also speaks ol the difficulty teachers haue 'm germae,
their fees paid, Fast. iii 829 vos, turba sere censu yraudata, ritagistrt. ἱ

158. ‘Do you duri me for your ieei‘: appellastis regma& ΧΨ xxx
