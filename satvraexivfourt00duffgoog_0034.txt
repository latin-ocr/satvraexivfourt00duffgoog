to a dish, containing various ingredients, and, by metaphor, to
a laW, comprising miscellaneous enactments. It is generally
supposed that the term, by a similar metaphor, was applied
to a form oi literature, treating oi various subjects and written
in a mixture oi prose and verse3 and it is apparently for this
reason that Juvenal speaks¹ oi nostri farrago libelli.

The word itseli, however, is much older than the kind of
literature to which it became eventually restricted For the
early history oi the word, our chief guide is a passage in
Livy², where, tracing the rise oi scenic representatione at
Rome, he incidentally refers to suturae, as one of many native
Italian iorrns oi the drama. He describes it as an improvised
dialogue oi rude and unpolished verse, which was first raised
to the rank oi a dramatic representation, by union with certain
Etruscan performances, consisting oi music and dancing only.

by the Greek play introduced by Livius Andronicus about
24013.c. Livy’s words seem to imply that aratura differed
from a regular play in having no plot Dialogue it possessed
from the beginning; but the scenes, of which it was composed‚
had no connexion with each other. lt consisted, apparently, oi
a succession oi scenes, drawn at random from common lile, in
which the Fescennine spirit oi rude and offensive banter
disported itseli with little pretensions to art and less to
decorum. Supplemented by musical accompaniment borrowed
