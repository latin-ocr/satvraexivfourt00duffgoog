SATIRE V.

Α DINNER·PARTY; GREAT ΜΕΝ AND THElR CLIENTS.

A good illustration of this satire is supplied by Pliny Epp. ii blongum
est altr'us repetere...ut bomo minime santiliaris cenarem apud quendam,

ut sibi videbatur, lauutm ct diligentem, mmihi, sordidum simulet
sumptuosam. ,nam sibi et paucis opima quaedam, cetm's vilia et minuta
ponebat. uiuum etiam...t'u tria genera descripserat, non ut potestas
eligendi, scd ne ius esset recusandi, aliud sibi et uobis, aliud uiinon'bus
anticis‚...aliud suis nostrisque libertis. Pliny expresses his disgust
at these arrangements, and ends his letter with a piece of advice
to his young friend and correspondent: igitur uramenta nibil magis
esse uitandum quam istam luxuriae et sordium nouam societatem.
Martia} attacks the same meanness3 see esp. iii 60. Lucian (de Merc.
Cond. 26) gives a similar account of the treatment of learned Greeks at
the tables of their great Roman patrons, in his time. Julius Caesar on
the other hand sent his baker to prison, because he had dared to
pnt before him a finer bread than he had given to his guests (Suet.
Iul. 48).

Some may be reminded of Macaulay’s account of the socia] standing
of an English domestic chaplain‚ two centuries ago: ‘he was per·
mitted to dine with the family3 buthe was expected to content himself
with the plainest fare. He might fill himself with the corned bees
and the carrots: but, assoon as the tarts and cheesecahes made their
appearance, he quitted his seat, and stood aloof till he was summoned
to return thanlrs ¹for the repast, frorn a great part of which he had
been excluded.’ Heiluy ff England, chap. 3. But even this was
less insulting than the treatment described by Juvenal and Pliny.
