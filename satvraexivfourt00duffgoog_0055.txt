writer of P are generally of a transparent kind: when he read

iumenta as tumenta (7, 180), and summula as summuia (7, 174),
he tried to make the words look like Latin by writing tumentia
and summa uia. The lines, as he wrote them, neither scan nor
construe ; but it is just his supreme merit that he did not try to
make them do so. To write tretruntn for iumenta is a blnnder3
to change lumenta to tumentia is a venial interpolation ; but to
transpose the words sufflamine multa is a grave interpolation.
Now the difference between P and ω is just this, that grave
interpolations are rare in P and common in ω. In Sat. 8, 148,
Biicheler’s report makes it highly probable that P read sufflamine
multa consul, and that the corrector transposed the words.

There are other letters which are apt to be confused in P:
we lind finals for final t, and vice versa, eg. lucebit for lucebis
(1, 1 5 5), deducit for deducis (1, 157), stetis sor stelit (1, 149). We
may infer that in some ancestor of P, as in P itseli, the two
letters were written much alike. The readings necabis ior
negabis (3, 168), ignium sor Ionium (6, 93), are remarkable: as
cand g, g and a are quite unlike in any cursive hand, these
errors are probably derived from some Ms. written in capitals
or uncials. P has another instructive error in Sat. 6, 159, reading
observant ubi festa nuda pede sabbata reges: this isos course
unmetrical, and a less honest copyist would have ‘corrected' it.
The true reading mera pade is given by the corrector and by all
other tiss Mera is a very rare and strange equivalent sor
nuda, which was accordingly written above as a ‘gloss’3 and
the copyist oi P wrote down the gloss in the text by mistake.
Again P makes Sat. ιο, 221 a heptameter by adding lutor
to the line: this word is a gloss, explanatory of Hirrus in the
line below, which has been added by an error to the text.
These two mistakes prove that the Ms. from which P was
copied had glosses between the lines: it was probably written
in uncials soon after the 6th century, with no divisions between
the words.

Again, it is now clear that P once contained the lost part of
the last book. Line 60 of the 16th satire is the last line of
the last page oi what is now the last quire oi the ms. lens
