cosmus was a famous persumet, often mentioned by Martial.

toto mergatur, ‘immerse his whole body': toto, by a common
idiom, goes rather with the subject of the sentence than with the word
with which it is grammatically connected3 cf. Mart. iv aa, 4 (of a
woman in a bath) lucebat, totr's cum tegeretur aquis, where totis
should be translated as tota. There is no adverb formed from
totus, which partly accounts for the idiom.

88. accipiet: seen. to ro, 26: P has accepiat, but the subj. seems
impossible here, and the reading of the worse MSS. is to be preferred:
in l. 91 P has mandat where mandet must be right.

89. anctorum: again ll. 99, 136: this name is osten somewhat
loosely applied to the inhabitants of subject provinces, who-are
properly stipendtbn‘i. ’

robbers of the provinces, not content with stripping· all the flesh off the

the common res Romana ‘the Roman state,’ rerum potiri etc. regum,
‘of the subject kings,' is an easier reading but has poor authority.
vacula exucta meamne: the meaning would be more accurately ex-
pressed by vacua exurar medullis: cf. [Sem] Herc. Oct. 1230 malum!
hausit medullas ,· ossibus vacuis sedat.

92. minine, ‘thuoderstroke': the word is used by Ovid of his
banishment by Augustus, T rist- i 1, 72 venit in froc illa fulmen ab arce
capua by Mart. of a condemnation by Domitian, vi 83, 3 nam tu missa
tua revocasti fulmina ἀπίηις aod by Statius (of the same case) Sr'lv. iii

quae duo fulmina domum meam...perculerint, non z'gnorarc vos arbitror,
and by stat. Silv. ii 1, 30.

93. comto: cf. Tac. Ann. xiii 33: Cossutianus Capito, legate of
Cilicia, was accused by the province before the senate aa). 57, and
