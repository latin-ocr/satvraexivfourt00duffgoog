104. cf. Mart· ii 18, a iam sumus ergo pares.

molior, ‘he is my superior': cf. l. 93.

105. alim...isois: so Statius says of a devoted attendant, Sc'lv.
ii 6, 5² tecum mittisque hilarisque mc unquam tiliarum, vultumque
tuo sumebat ab ore: contrast with this what Martial says to a friend
whom he is inviting to dine with him (v 78, 24) et vultu placidus tuo
recumbes, ‘you will sit at ease with your natural expression?

106. rasim manus, ‘to throw up the hands,’ asa sign of admi·
ration3 cf. Mart. x ro, io gentinus tendis in ora manus (of a flatterer
hstening to a recitation).

107. This is imitated by Amm. Marcell. xxvii 3, 5 honio in-
dagmnter admodum sentinam, si, etiam cum spueret, non lauda-
retur.

108. ‘if the golden cup, when the bottom is turned upwards¹
has given forth a smaeking sound’; i.e. if the rich man has drunk
off his glass with no heel-taps. Cf. Hamlet i 4

And, as he drains his draughts ot Rhenish down,

The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out

The triumph oi his pledge.
crepitus is the gurgling sound with which the last drops leave the cup.
Another explanation, which makes trulla=lasunum, suits the context

sense and regularly means a vessel for drinking out ol; cl. llor.
Sat. ii 3, ¹443 Mart. ix 96, 13 Cic. in Verr. ii 4, 61. Others
think that a kind of κότταβὸς is meant, a game ot which the object
was to throw a small quantity of wine at a mark ; but (1) κότταβος
is never mentioned as a Roman gome, (a) furzdus alone cannot stand
ior ‘cup,' nor trulla sor the πλάστιγξ or sancet into which the wine
was thrown.

1¹3· mus, ‘in consequence ’3 cf. 6, 139.

114. coepit is a pers. of which incipio supplies the present. In
Cicero it is always followed by the int, which must be active (except
in the case ofſseri which is regarded as middle); but in later prose
and in poetry the constr. without the ins. is common; cs. Lucr. v 1416
sic odium coepit glandis.

transt, ‘pass by, say nothing os’: transire has only this meaning
in Juv.; cs. 6, 6013 7, ¹903 10, ²73·
