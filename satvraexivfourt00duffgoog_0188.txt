124 JUVENAL, 1.

uda: ie. the ring is breathed upon bet'ore being used for sealing.

7ο. ruo...sittente must be abl. absol. 3 but the constr. is awkward
as the reader naturally connects viro with porrectura. rubetam: ef.
6, 659; aeonite is the other poison most frequently mentioned by
Juvenal.

71. neema: a Gallie woman and skilful poisoner, who employed
her art against Claudius and Britannicus3 she also provided Nero, her
pupil and employer‚ with means of death in his extremity: cf. Tae Anu.
xii 66, xiii 155 Suet. Nero 47. She was executed by Galba.

72. per temam et populum, ‘in the tace of seandal and before the
eyes of the people’: the constr. ean hardly be called hendiadys‚ as por
populum alludes to the custom of the funeral proeession passing through
the sorum, on the way to the place of interment outside the walls.

’ nigros: the colour is due to poison: ef. ad Herenn. ii 8 si...livore
decoloratum corpus est mortui, significor eum venem necatum.

73. dyada: ei. ro, 170. Gyara (or Gyarus) is an island in the
Aegean3 the bad water-supply made confinement in Gyara'a very severe
punishment (Tac. Ann. iv 30)- Confinement to an island was a common
punishment in imperial times3 thus there is ancient precedent for the ,
banishment os Napoleon to St Helena, of Garibaldi te Caprera, and
ol Arabi to Ceylen. deportatio in insulam, the punishment meant
here, was much more severe than relegatio: it involved loss of civil
rights and generally confiscation of property (see n. to l. 48): it was
the imperial substitute for the republican aquae et agnis interdictio.

earcere suggests execution: es. 13, 245.

. 74. esse aliquid, ‘to beaperson oi importanee'3 cf. Pliny Epp.i
o 3, n cum tribunus essem, erraverim fortasse qui me aliquid putavi.
probitas...alget may be called a μέν clause, ertmlntbus...eaprum

a corresponding δέ clause3 the clauses are more strongly opposed
in Latin when there are no particles, though quidem...aerum, and other
combinabons, are sometimes used for this purpose.
75. criminibus: crinrrn=‘accusation,’ always in Cicer03 but in
· poetry and silver Latin it has the meaning ‘crime’ as osten as the
other.

honos: horti, ‘a pleasuregarden’ or ‘parln' is to be distinguished
from hortus, ‘a hail-yard’ or ‘kitchengarden’
mem: ef. l. 137. Pliny (Nat. Hist. xiii 91) in his botanical section
takes occasion to reprove the mensarum insania quas sentinae atra
‘orffa magoam'rar regnunt, he. when women are attamen iet tbe'u
