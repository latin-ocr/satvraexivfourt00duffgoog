through which the Argo passed, with the IIhayrral, an equally dan·
gerous pair oi rocks which stood iu the way of Odysseus (oa xii
59-1α)Ι

ao. mels:theCyaneanrocksareidenticalwiththeSymplegades:
ci. Eur. Med. a Κυανέας Συμπληγάδας. Munro says that Cyaneis denotes
the whole ol which saxa form part, and is dat, as incedentia nunebra
homini ε but the expression is very strange. Ruperti proposed Cyaneas
(those clnshing rocks, the Cyaneae); and it is possible that the acc. in
apposition may have misled the copyists.

plenos govems tenpestatibus: the reference is to the ἀσκός given by
Aeolus to Odysseus (od. x 19-27).

αι. madidam, ‘I could believe’: the constr. is like the eor.
optat. with dv in Greek: see nn to 7, ¹403 8, 30.

For the enchantments oi Circe, cf. ΟΛ. x 233-2403 and for the fate
of Elpenor, s'bs'd 552-560.

²4· merito, sc. dixisset: cf. 6, 642: such an interruption would
have been quite justified. Odysseus told the whole story super cenam
(l. 14), while the wine was going round.

ay. corcyrae: the sairy-land of Phaeacia was generally identified

by the ancients with Corcyra (Corsa).

duxerat, ‘had drunk.' dealexerat, the reading ol the inferior ress.
including the Bobio palimpsest (see Introd. p. xliv), is a corruption
apparently due to ignorance oi the scansion of tinuitmn.

26. Ithacus: cf. 14, 287.

nullo subtectio, ‘with none to bear him out‚’ all his company having
lost their lives before he reached Phaeacia. For the idiomatic use oi
sub, cf. Livy ii 37, 8 consules cum ad patres rem dubiam sub auclore
certo (on good authority) detulissent. nullo teste would mean the same:
ef. 10, 70.

27. nuper: consequently the tale, though marvellous, can be
tested. An inscription proves that Aemilius Juncus and Julius Severus
were consuls in the year 1²7 Aa). The satire was therefore written
after that date, though how long alter, is uncertain, as nuper is a word
oi elastic meaning: cf. 8, 120, where it refers to a period probably
twenty years earlier; also Pliny Paneg. 8, where nuper refers to an event
oi thirty-one years before.

28. super, ‘beyond’ i-e. south of: ci. rursus ro, 150.

coptos wasa city on the utre, 'm the Upper Thebaid, oi consider·

29. cothurnis, ‘tragedre
