288 Juvenan, v11.

this sense, but the constr. is usually a personal accus: cf. Mart. vii 92, 3
appellat regida tristis me vace Secumins3 Juv. 9, 64 appellat puer unicus
‘my one slave duns me’ for his wages. Seneca uses the same constr„
Dial. ix rr, 3 appellaverit natura quae (nent.) prior nabis credidit.

¹59· laevae..mamillua: as generally in Latin, me heart is the seat,
not of feeling, but of intellect.

160. salit: the word is often used of the beating of a pulse3 cf.
Ovid Met. x 289 (of Pygmalion's statue coming to life) saliunt tertqttatae
pollice venae. Juv. means that the youth is duri ingenii, dull, stolia
armum may be translated ‘bucolia’ the Arcadians being proverbial in
Greece for ἀγροικία. So Quintilian (ii 8, 7) says dryly of pupils in the
school, nonnulli rus fhrtasse mittendi. ,

mihi: the rhetor himself is supposed to be the speaker.

Once a week there is n formal exhibition in the school, attended by ’
anxious parents, when each pupil delivers a suasoria or speech purport·
ing to be made by some historical personage at some important crisis
of his career: see n. to 1, ι6. Hannibal was commonly used for this
purpose; cf. ro, 167.

161. diruo is the common epithet of Hannibal, eg. Hor. Carm. ii
η, a with Page’s note; here it has a secondury sense, ie. cursed by the
rhetor.

162. deliberat is the technicnl word used in the lemmata of these
suasoriam cf. Quint. iii 8, ¹9 deliberat C. Caesar, an perseveret in
Germaniam ire, cum milites passim testamenta facerent.

It must be noted that an petat urbem..., an...circuntagat...cokortcs
does not refer to an alternative before H. at one time, but to two quite
different occasions, the latter being in 211 ue„ five years after Cannae,
when he offered battle under the walls of Rome: see n. to 6, ²913 cf.
Livy xxvi 11 instructis utrimque exercitibus in eius pargnac casum,
in qua urbs Roma aretari praernium esset, imber iugens grandine namtas
utramque aciem turbavit. ...et postero die...acies instructas eadem tcm-
pestas diremit.

164. a, ‘after’ and ‘in consequence of '; to be taken after madidas,
not after circumagat.

165. The rhetor speaks, saying he would give anything to oblige
the boy's father to listen as often to the wearisome speech. The final
clause (ut...amirat) is to be taken closely both with the imperative
clause (quantum...accipe), and with quid da, which is added asyn-
detically. Transl. ‘bargain for any sum you please, and l'lt pay ir

on the spot-I’d give anything lor his father to hear xmm aa ouen*
