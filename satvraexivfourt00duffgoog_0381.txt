Nosne. 317

(Opnsc. p. 545) explains sua funera as relliquias mortuas lonii generis:
perhaps rather ‘their moral suicide? an oxymoron like dagnus morte perit
l. 85; after such a disgruceful compliance, they cannot be said to be
living. Accepting this, what does quanti mean? what is the price
spoken of? The logie of the passage shows that quanti has the same
syntactical relation to vendant as cogente Nerone to vendunt. Tlrerefore
quanti refers not to a sum oi money paid to nobles for compliance, but
to the motive which compelled them, ie. fear of death. The whole
passage may then be paraphrased: ‘you say that the motiva, for which
Nero’s nobles sold their dead selves, was a powerful one: but that is
unimportant3 for they do the very same under Trajan and Hadrian,
with no fear of suffering death from a tyrant; they do it at the shows of
a mere praetor, notan emperor! (This explanation of suezera and
quanli was given by Mr Lendrum‚ Classical Reuiew iv p. 229.)

is the view of Tacitus and Juv. on this point. For similar appearances
in public of nobles before Nero's time, see Furneaux's note to Tac.

circus and theatre was transferred by Augustus from the aediles to the

In the theatre the praetor, as president, sat ‘throned on high’ (celsus) on
his tribunal, immediately over the stage on the spectator’s left, like the
‘royal box' in a modern theatre.
