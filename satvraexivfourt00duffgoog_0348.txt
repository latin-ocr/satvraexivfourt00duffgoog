1²4· Aemilius is a noble and therefore receives the full fee permitted
by law (quantum licat). The most famous law oonceming the fees of
advocates was the lex Cincr'a of ac. 204, making any fee illegal: this
was repealed ,by Claudias who allowed a maximum fee of ro,ooo
sesterces: roo aurei (Tac. Ann. xi 5—7): there was further legislation
under Nero to protect litigants (Suet. Nero ry). Pliny (Epp. vi 23, r)
lets us know that he spoke without remuneration. Quintilian discusses
the question in a common-sense way (xii 7, 8): he objects chiefly to a
bargain made beforehanrl, but asserts the duty of the client to show his
gratitude practically.

trian statues of great lawyers seem to have been common: cf. Mart. ix

127, 128. There are serious difficulties in this description, obviously
sarcastic, of the armed equestrian statue of a lawyer. A spent-shaft
should be straight; why is it curvatum here? M. explains that the
shalt bends when poised for the throw; but it would be strange to
represent this in a statue. Friedl. suggests that curv. isused for
rotatum, ‘brandished,' but gives no similar instance.

lusca offers a second difficulty: various explanations are given, ag.
that the statue has one eye closed, as taking aim; that the statue is seen
in profile; that Aemilius may have been luscus himself. From the
point of view of art, all 'these are unsatisfactory. Friedl. suggests
that the eye-hails were, as often, represented by coloured stones, one of
which has fallen out.

If we accept the last view, perhaps curvatum may be ‘crooked, out
of the perpendicular’: Juv. then means that the statue is badly wrought
and in bad repair.
