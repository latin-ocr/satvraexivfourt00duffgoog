108, 109. There is some doubt as to the meaning oi gibbus here: it
means ‘a hump' 10,a94,and generally as an adj. means ‘convert’ as
opposed to ‘concave’: is it means ‘a polypus' or swelling inside the
nose, it can hardly be rubbed by the helmet: hence some take attritus
as anoun, ‘a sore place caused by the helmet! But ingens seems in
favour oi understanding gibbus as an excresceuce on the nose with which
the closed helmet would corne in contact. A figure oi a Thraexlwho
also is secto lacerto) with his helmet closed, is given in Baumeister’s
Denhmeiler p. 2098.

osten used figurativcly: cf. 7, 1713 Hor. Epp. i 1, a spectatum satis
et denatum iam rude.

Veiento videri: perh. Fabricius Veiento (3, 185): if Veiento was

Ι the senator to whom Eppia was married, the meaning is that Sergius,
no longer a gladiator, would be as unattractive to Eppia as her own
husband; ii Veiento was not her husband, Juv. must mean the name to

be typical os repulsive qualities. The iormer explanation seems to give
more point.

136-141. Same men give the highest character af their wives; but
they have some special reason far doing sa. Thus Censennia can a'o
eea wrong in her husband‘s eyes because she is rich.

that price he gives her the reputation of chastity'; bis quingena, usually
cupressea by ahct'em, is about Archoo. This was the arnount of the

senatorial census and is osten mentioned as a rich woman's doum ci.
