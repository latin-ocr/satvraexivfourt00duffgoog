7. ‘Not indeed compelled, but also not presented, by the tribune’

When a Roman citima was about to hire himself as a gladiator, he was
obliged to signify his intention to one of the tribuni plebis, who ap·
parently had po'wer to sanction or annul such a contract (auctoramentum).
cogente need not imply that the tribune had power to compel a man to
take this step; it may refer to the fact that many hod been compelled
by tyrannical emperors: cf. 8, 193 nullo cogente Nerone.
neo should be noticed: in classical prose ne...quidem would be
used; but in the siiver age nec is used for both senses of ne...quidem,
(1) ‘not even,' (a) ‘also not,’ where there is no comparison between
the things negatived. Comp. Mart. ii 36, 1 flectere tc nolim sed nec
(also not) turbore capillos, with Sen. Epp. 5, gnon splendeat loga;
nc sordcel quiicm. In either passage, ‘not even’ would imply that one
habit was worse than the other; whereas the writers put them on the
same level, as equally blameworthy. Cf. too Sen. de Bon. iv 9, a (we
ought to choose carefuliy the recipients of our benefits) queis ne agricolae
qur'elem sencino leorerris committunt, ‘fermers also do not plough the
. sand': ‘not even’ would imply that sarmers know loss of agriculture
than other people. This neo may be transl. ‘neither'; but must be
distinguished from ‘neither’ preceding ‘nor,¹ which is entirely different,
as different as οὔτε from οὐδέ. ’

8. ‘Soon to sign the conditions and tyrannous terms of the
trainer’: the reference is to the oath taken by gladiators, given most
fully in Peteon. 117 in verba Eumolpi sacramentum iuravimus: uri
almiri oerbmori ferroque necari, el quicquid aliud Eumolpus iussisset.
tanquam legitimi gladiomres domino corpora animasque religiosissime
addicimus. The quotation shows that verbo is used of the oath dictated ¹
by the lanista, not of the words of command used in training. ’

regia implies that the gladiator contracted himself out ol his legal
rights, so that the lonisla became rex over him, i.e. a person whose
actions were not limited by any law.

For nobles fighting as gladiators, cf. 8, 199; and, for this end to a
career of extravagance, cf. Sen. Epp. 99, r 3 ospicc illos iuvenes quos erc
nobilissimis domibus in harenam luxuria proiecit.

9. elusus, ‘hillen’

ro. mansor, ‘money-lender’; creditum is the regular word for
‘money lent,' ‘a loan,’ medere, ‘to lend money'; cf. Mart. iii 15 plur
credit nemo lota quom Cordus in urbe. Ι cum sit lom pauper, quomodo?

caecus amal. marani: see n. to b, 40.

rr. vivendi causa: cf. 8, 84·
