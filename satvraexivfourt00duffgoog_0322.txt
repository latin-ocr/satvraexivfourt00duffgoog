Suetonius (Otito 4), Seleucus. The text seems tc imply that he had
once heen intimate with Galba and had transferred his allegiance
to Otho ior gain3 nothing is known of this from other sources. ’
’ conducenda, lit. ‘able to be hired’ tabella. is a document containing
the calculations by which his high destiny was proved to Otho. For
the quantity os obit, see n. to 3, ¹74·

Tbese two lines would be better away, as they limit the reference, in
an awkward way, to one astrologer in particular, who is hardly likely to
have survived until this date. They are inserted in the margin of P by
the second hand ; yet they certainly read like Juv's writing.

559. formidatae othoni: it would seem more natural to say that
Otho was dreaded by Galba3 but the reference may be to the pretence
that his lise was in danger, which Otho had recourse to, in order to
lessen the insamy of his action3 cf. Tac. Hirt. i ar [Otho] fingebat et
metum quo magis concupisceret ;...occidi Othonem posse.

560. indo...artla, ‘their confidence in his skill depends cn
whether...) forrc=manicin ,

561. longo: the sense required seems to be ‘sor a long time’; the
distance or neamess of the prison is irrelevant. The adj. is used lor the
adverb longum: cf. 8, 47.

amarorum tn carcero: see n. to 3, 314.

562. genium...nauoult, ‘will get credit sor genius’; gneius usually
means the attendant spirit which lives in each man during his lise, and
to which bloodless sacrifices were offered on birthdays3 here its meaning
seems to approach that oi ingenium. The idea ofa ‘familiar spirit’ as
a magician’s helper seems foreign to Juv.’s age. Cl. Mart. vi 60,1o
victurus genium debet nabere liber; Stat. Sila. iv 6, 19 nox...memo-
rande diu geniumque habitura perennem.

563. ln cyclada mitti: for this punishment (deportato in insulam),
see n. to 1, 73. The group of little islands surrounding Delos in the
Aegean were and are still known by the common nameus Cyclades.

564. contigit suggests that he was lucky to escape a capital
sentence, tandem that he was confined for a term of years in Seriphos,
now Serpho, one of the Cyclades ; cs. ro, 170.

camlaee=drahhcyiuaiz cf. ιο, 287; 14, 151: carere is also often used
os a desirable object, e-g. money (1, 59), sleep (3, 56), shows (11, 53). ·

565. lanto, ‘long delayed’: cl. tardas colus 14, ²4⁸3 Ovid Met. i
