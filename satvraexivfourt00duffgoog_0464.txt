400 JUVENAL, XIII.

81. psus aegeas: the attributes of Poseidon are transferred to the
Roman god.

83. ‘And all the weapons contained in the armouries of heaven':
ie. he swears by any other gods there are and by the weapons they
carry. telomm is governed by quidquid.

Juv. is mocking descriptions of the gods’ weapons such as occur in
Epic poetry: a specimen will be found in Lucan vii 144-150.

84. Cf. Pliny Epp. ii ao, 6 fucit hoc Regulus non minus scelerate
quam frequenter, quod iram mmor, quas ipse cotidie fcrllit, in caput
infelicis pueri detestatur (ie. he perjures himself after swearing by his
son’s life). This boy died young.

et, ‘als0,' modifies pater est. comedam is pres. subj., the condition,
si mentior, being understood: the swindler imprecates on himself the
doom of Thyestes, as a climax of horror: cf. 6, 16.

85. Phario...aeetos Egyptian vinegar seems to have been good:
cf. Mart. xiii 122 maure. amphora Niliaci non sit tihi vilis aceti,·l
esset cum vinum, vilior illasuit. Juv.’s language is purposely ludicrouss
the perjuret would not have added these picturesque details himself.

rather than surrender their unlawfulgoins. These restect also that
‘the mills of Godgrind slowly‚’ thal their punishment may bc long
delayeal, that it may never conte at all. Hence thur find couragc
to swear the salse ooth. They play a part like sleilsul actors,
while the friend they have rabbad reproaches the gods sor their
indifference.

86. ‘Some refer all events to the accidents of chance,’ i.e. are
atheists, fortuna being here opposed to divine agency. JuV. seems
to take this view generally, though, as he indicates elsewhere (14, 315),
Fortune was often personified as a deity, so that her worshippers found
themselves in harmony, to some extent, with religion, thus ‘reconciling
opposites by the apotheosis of a negation’ Fumeaux, Tac. Anu. 1 p. 21.
The Epicureans are especially meant: cf. Tac. Ann. vi aa nn'lzz'...in
incerto iudicium est, salone res mortalium et necessitate immutabili an
forte volvantur, where the satum and necessitas of Stoicism are opposed
to the Fortuna of Epicureanism. As a matter of fact the Epicureans,

though holding that the atoms which form a world codescednw enasse,
