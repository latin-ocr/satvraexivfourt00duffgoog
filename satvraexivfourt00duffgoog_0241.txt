nuta de meroe is explained ‘from a stock oi damaged wares'3
C. bought salt fish, which had gone bad, from the wholesale dealers
and hawked it through the streets.

But the sense offlaeta (which was read by the Scholiast) is very
unusual; and, as T agrees with P in reading saeta, it seems likely that
the true reading is Pharaia, a common equivalent t'or Aegyptiace:
cf. 13, 853 Stat. Silo. ii 1, 73 miletus Phariis venalis mercibus r'sefans.
Pharia would be likely to appear as faria in a latin ris-2 see Hosius
on Lucan viii 546, x ¹7¹ z then faria became sarta and finally saeta, of
which fracta is a correction,

The statement of Crispinus’ birth and occupations is probably an

37. Flavius ultimus: Domitian was the younger of Vespasian’s
two sons and the last oi his race who sat on the throne. The Scholinst
on this line cites as the end ol an epigram by Martial: Flavia gens,
quantum tibi tertius abstulit heres! Ι paenesuit tanti non habuisse duos,
‘how much glory the Flavian house lost by its third representative!
it would almost have been better not to have had the other two'
ie. than to have had all three, including Domitian. Tne adingam
