noras. 185

106. ‘And nevertheless more impudent than a profligate turned
satirist': for the restricted meaning of the word satura, as used by
Juv., see Introd. pp. xxx-xxxiii.

107. Montani...ventors cf. spatium rhombi l. 39. It is not certain
whether the Montanus, who distinguished himself so greatly on this
occasion, is mentioned elsewhere: he was evidently an old man at this
time; cf. ll. 136 foll.

108. Crispinus only comes in for this passing and comparatively
lenient mention, in spite of the beginning of the satire.

'l'o use scent in the morning is a sign of an idle and dissolute life:
the custom was to use perfumes, together with chaplets of flowers, only
at the ceneissatio, which followed the cena 3 cf. 9, 128 dum bibiena, dum
serta, unguerem, puellas Ι percinens, erepit non intellecta senectus3 also
ιι, taa; 15, 50.

109. fanen: Roman poetry is full of allusions to the custom of
pouring perfumes and scented oils over the pyres of the dead; the body
also was perfumed: cf. Propert. v 7. 3² eur nardo flammae non eluere
aseae? Pers. 3, ¹04 compositus lecte crassisque lutatus (daubed) aillamis.

110. Pompeius, adeletae, is not mentioned elsewhere.

aperire (‘to slit’) is governed by saevior: cf. Sen. Dial. iii a, a
ira iussit...alium servili mareu regalem aperire iugulum (surely a
quotation from tragedy though not so marked by Haase).

susurrus has here, like ψιθυρισμός, the notion of slandering.

111—112. Cornelius Fuscus, then praefect of the praetorian guard,
was defeated and killed as chief commender in the Dacian war 86-
88 run-3 there is an epitaph for his grave in Mart. vi 76, and some
account of his earlier years in Tac. Hisl. ii 86. Now, says Juv, he
was studying the art of war in the lap of luxury.

¹¹3· Fabricius Veiento and L. Valerius Catullus Messalinus were
two of the most infanfous delatores under Domitian. The former
continued to be about the court under Nerva; cf. Pliny Epp. iv aa
for a story in which both he and Catullus come in. Catullus was
consul 73 mn. ς he was living in 93 (cf. Tac. Agre'c. 45 intra Albanam
arcem sententia Messalini strepebat) but appears, from Pliny l.l., not
to have survived Domitian (96 aaa).

¹¹4· numquam visae s Catullus was blind ς cf. Pliny l.l. luminibus
orbatas ingenio saeua neala caecitatis addiderat.

115. Many as were the scandals of the age, Catullus surpassed
them all,· cf. a, 143 aicit et leae neanslrum tunicati tassetan Gratusi,N
‘eren this scandal was surpassed hy the tunic and trident oi assracdxxss·
