nores. 337

Egypt and Africa (seen. to 8, ιη), under the superintendence ol the
praefectus annonas (see n. to 4, 32): for the system of distribution,
seen. toy, 174.

arcanam, se. ludos, ‘races,' rather than ‘ games': see nn. to 3, ²23 ;
10, 36 (pompa Circcmis); 11, 198. The conversation, interrupted
l. 72, is here resumed

uenturos...mn1tos: cf. Tac. Anu. vi 19 (Tiberius) cunctos, qui ’
carcerc attitulantur accusati societatis cum Sereno, necari iubet. iacuit
inmensa strages, omnis semus, omnis aclas, inlustres, ignobiles. Suet.
(Tib. 61) speaks ol twenty executions in one day as something
exceptional ; so the language of Tac. seems exaggerated.

aa. magna ost tomeun, ‘the furnaceis a big onesta colloquial
way of expressing that ‘many will find it hot! The diminutive has
lost all diminutive sense, when such an epithet as magara can be applied
to it ; cl. μέγα θηρίον Hom. od. x 171.

paludatus: see n. to lividulus 11, 110.

83-85. Madvig (Optatai 44) explains this as follows: Bruttidius
was in the habit of declaiming in the schools, where one of the stock
subjects os debate (curlroverst'ae, see n. to 1, 16) was the armorum
iudicium between Ajax and Ulysses: cl. 7, 115: Β. had made apoor
speech on the side of Ajax, and the speaker here, who is not really
a friend, says ironically, ‘how Ι sear that Ajax, beaten in his case,
is punishing B. for his bad speech ’ς the real cause of B.'s pallor is of
course his sear ol being involved in the downsall of Sejanus.

But there is no proof that Bruttidius spoke in the schools: he is
mentioned as a historian by Seneca (Suasor. 6, eo) not as a declaimer.
And it is simplet to understand Tiberius by Ajax‚ such ause ol
Homeric names being common (see n. to Automedon 1, 61), and to
suppose that the speaker is expressing his sear that the emperor may
punish freely in resentment for the danger he has run. Just as
Ajax killed the cattle, so Tiberius, like Ajax when he lost the prize
(vr'clus Aiax), may slaughter the citizens, under the impression that (ut)
he has been ill defended. Consequently the two speakers, in order to
prove their zeal, make haste to kick the prostrate body ol the emperor's
foe: this is the form their dq‘ensr'o takes.

This Bruttidius is probably Bruttidius Niger, who, as aedile mn. aa,
prosecuted Silanus lor maiestas (Tae. Anu. iii 66, a). The altar ol
Mars was in the Campus Martius.

86. ln ripa, sc. Tibm's: the body ol Seianus, as banse ok manu
vlle! cffmluals, was thrown into the river aiter being exposed·
