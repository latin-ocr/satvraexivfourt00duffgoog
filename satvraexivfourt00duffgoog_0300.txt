236 Juvenum, vi.

rhetorical schools, constantly used by Seneca and Quintiliane it is the
favourable light in which a speaker endeavours to place an action which

he is desendinge cf. Quint. iv 1, roo ne illud quidem igowrare oportet,
quaedam csse quae colorem non recipiant sed tontum wfoedenda sint3

Ovid Τ rist. i 9, 63 ergo ut defendi nullo mea posse colore, Ι sic excusati
crimina posse putu the passages quoted show that color is not a mere
synonym of exntsate‘o, the latter being used where the former was im·
possible.

181. haeremus, ‘I am puzzled'3 cs. Trajan ad Plin. 81 potuisti non
haerere, ‘yon need not heve been puzzled.’ This is supposed to be
Quint.'s answer. convenerat, ‘it was settled long ugo'3 nothing is here
expressed by the pipi, which the aorist would not equally convey.

283. maru 11111 confundas: used proverbially of making a great
disturbance; cs. 1, 15 quis caelum tem's non ntesceatetmarecaelo? Livy
iv 3, 6 quid tandem est cnr caelum ac terras misceant?

284. homo 111111 has two common meanings: (1) I have the seelings
oi a man; so Terence Haut. Tim. 77 hoton suen ; humani nihil a me
alienun puto. (1) Ι have the weaknesses of a man; so Petron. 75
nemo, inquit, nostonmnonpeccat. nominassemus, non dei. The latter
meaning is required here. But perhaps a third meaning is possible, ie.
1 have the rights os a man and will not be treated like a slave (cs. l.
111) or an animal.

1111111 or quid is generally preferred in such sentences to noento or quis:
cf. Mart. i 10, 3 adeone pulcra est? immo fhedz'ns nil est ι no doubt nihil
is more comprehensive.

185. deprensis, ‘when they are detected' 3 said of the crime l. 640.
crimine is ‘guilt,' not ‘accusation’ Cf. Tac. Ann. i 38 praestitiam ab
audacia mutuatur.

286-309: This corruption of morals was unknown e’n the days when
life at Rome was hard and simple ,· peace has brought luxury e'n its
train, a worse nnnzy than war,· and now all the corruptions of
foreign nott'ons have found a home here. How con yon expect virtue
in a wonoan who e's nol even sober? It is easy to eundorstand their
contnnpt for the altar os chastity.

186. monum: cf. l. 645 and prodigio l. 84.
188. contingi, ‘to be polluted’; cf. contacta 5, 118, It is difficult
to detemrine whether tecta is aco, or the inst oi anumber oi subiects
to sonabant the object being eas understood irom Latinos.
²89· venere hisco: the women oi old spent much oi men· timens
