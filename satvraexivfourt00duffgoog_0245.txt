NOTES. 181

68. sua...nooura=your happy reign. The plur. is due to metre:
Pliny, writing to (and oi) Trajan, osten uses tuum socculum in this sense
but never the plural.

69. lpse capi voluit: ci. Mart. ix 31, 5 (oi a goose sacrificed in
honour of Domitian) ipse suas anser properavit laetam ad oras.

quta spernunt ie. uo 'flattery could be more barelaced; ci. Cic.
lael. 99 aperte adulantem nenro non videt, nisi qui admodum est excors.

7ο. anua: so we call a man ‘erest-sallen': we may translate,
‘he began to plume himself)

71. tlls aequm ci. Pliny Paneg. 4 (oi the Roman emperors) prin·
copem quem aequata dis immortalibus potestas deceret. Domitian himself
began a public circular, professing to come irom his treasury officials,
with the words dontinus et dores noster hoc sieri iubet (Suet. Dom. 13);
Martial constantly uses such language to him. For the elliptic corn·
parison (dis=dcomcm poterion), see n. to 3, 74.

72. pannas memora, ‘a dish oi the right size’; ci. Thuc. iii ao
τὴν ξυμμέτρησιν τῶν κλιμάκων, ‘the right length sor the ladders.¹

73. proceres are not the same as potres in l. ⁶43 the latter are
casual senators waiting ior Domitian's leve'e; but the proceres (as appears
from amicitiae l. 75, conces l. 84, arctici l. 88) are the personagcs techni-
cally styled arrrici Caesaris or ‘Privy Councillors.' This Cabinet ol
advisers originated by Augustus was more lormally constituted by
Tiberius and continued by h'is successors: cf. Suet. Tib. 55 orgirrti sibi
c courcero principum civitatis depoposcerat veluti consiliarios in ragotiis
publicai; id. Tit. 7 amicos elegit, quibus etiam postcunt principes u!
ct sibiet reip. necessariis adquieverunt praeceptorque surr! usi. The
Cabinet generally included not only the chiel senators, such as the
consuls, praefectus urbi and other consulars, but also those knights who
occupied the three or iour highest posts accessible to their order; see
note to 1. 32. Eleven are mentioned as present on this occasion.

Thus those who were called the Emperor's ‘friends’ might be, as
in this case, those to whom he was least friendly.

74· magnae: ‘with Majesty’; seen. to r, 33.

75. liburno: the name of this Dalmatian people is commonly
used sor slaves of different kinds, ior an usher here and Mart. i 49, 33,
ior a sedan-bearer Juv. 6, 477. Cf. the use ol Suissc in French ior
a beadle or ornamental portes.

76. abolla: seen. to 3, ¹15·
