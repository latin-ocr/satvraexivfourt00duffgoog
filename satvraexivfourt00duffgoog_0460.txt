really sing. in meaning: see ιι. to 6, ²4² and this makes its connexion

relern'ng to the oth century of the city ; but oetas naturally refers in this
context to the ages known as golden, silver etc.; cf. 6, ²3 and 24 ; so
norea would require eight ages, each named after a separate metal. But
the longest of such lists, that of Hesiod‚ recognises only (1) a golden
age, (a) a silver age, (3) a brazen age, (4) a heroic age, (5) an iron age.

togata, Ι non tu, Pomponi, cena diserta tua est; Pliny Epp. ii 14, 4
sequuntur auditores, actoribus similes, conducti et redempti: manceps
(a contractor) convenitur: in media basilica tam palam sportulae quom
