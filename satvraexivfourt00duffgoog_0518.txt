dividuals must have been treated in the missing part ol the satire.

8. illud...ne: utnon would be correct, as an ut clause defining

ntea, quatiens a medicis relictus! But the rest of the 1. seems incon·
sistent with such a desperate condition oi the eye.

Bardaei (or Vardaei) a tribe of Illyria: cf. Mart. iv 4, 5 lassi vardaicus
