181. Cf.4,r3. cerdoni=plehcia Theword isaGreek proper name
(Κέρδων) usually borne by slaves or workmen: it occurs in Herondas
Mim. 6 and 7 as the name, apparently a common one, of a ahoe-maker,
and is also given by Martial to one os the same trade (iii 16, 59 and 99)
apparently as a proper name; it is found in Petron. 60 (where of two
slaves one is called Cerdo, another Lucria, a Latin equivalent), in
Persius 4, 51, Juv. 4, 153 and here. In Latin it is clearly used as
a contemptuous soubriquet for the class engaged in small trade and
handicrafts, those whom Cicero (pro Flacc. 17) calls sutores ct coriarii:
cf. the French lprmer.

Volesos: one of the great names of early Rome: the father of

183—210. Conduct like this in our rwhlcs is bad enough, hut worse
· remains behind: they have actually stooped to appear on 111 stage in
lowsarces. T 11 prople too arc to blame for their willingness to look
on 01 such 0, disgracesul sight. Under Nero, when refusal might
ntean death, there might have been some excuse far the nobles ; hut
even in our own time, when there is no compulsum, they still appear
on 111 stage. A true acan would prefer death to such a disgrace os
this. There is only onc downward step possible after this; and coen
that 1111111,1υ1111 a Gracchus appears as a gladiator in the arena.
And further, 11 chooses to appear as a retiarius, on purpose that his
face may hc uncovered and that he may 11 recognisecl hy all 111
spectators. 711 antagonist‚ who fighls with him, suffers disgrace
worse than any wounal.

185. Damasippo: Horace (Sat. ii 3) has a character of this name,
who has ruined himself by speculation in works of art; but Juv. is
probably speaking of some otherwise unknown figure of Nero's time.

vocem...locauti: anyone, appearing as an actor or singer at public
shows, was said vocem locare practori3 see n. to l. ¹94·

186. nnana, ‘to the cartain’: farces (utimr) were played on the
front part of the stage, which was divided from the back by the
siparium, which is therefore used as :mimus: cf. Sen. Dial. ix 11, 8
Publius, tragicis comicisque vehementior ingeniis, quotiens mimr'cas
ineptias 11 verba od summam caveam spectantia reliquit, intes trinita
