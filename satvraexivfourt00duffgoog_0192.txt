was convicted at once as an Oriental, because his ears were pierced, and

was driven ont os the ranks: Xen. Anah. iii 1, 31 ἀλλὰ τούτῳ γεοϋτετῆτ

Βοιωτίας προσήκει οὐδὲν οὔτε τῆς Ἑλλάδος παντάπασιν, ἐπεὶ ἐγὼ αὐτὸν
’ εἶδον ὥσπερ Λυδὸν τὰ ulra τετρυπημένον. ’

105. matut, ‘might prove': the subj. is potentia] rather than
conditiona13 the aorist and present are both used potentially, but the
aor. is commoner with the first person (eg. dixerim), the pres. with the
others. There is no difference in meaning between the tenses, any more
than between λέγοιμ’ dv and εἴποιμ’ dv.

106. quadringenta, sc sestertia, 4oo,0oo sesterces-about gaece,
'was the census ol a Roman knight; here the amount seems to be
income, not capital. Even so, the speaker would not be nearly as rich

as Pallas (cf. Tac. Ann. xii 53), than whom he claims to be richer.

for ‘people like Licinus.’)

110. sacro...honorl: Livy (ii 33) speaks os a lex sacrata by which
the persons ol the tribunes were made inviolable; but there is some
doubt whether this was a compact between the patricians and plebeiam,
or merely a solemn engagement of'the latter to avenge any wrong done
to their representatives. In either case, this magistracy was styled
sacrosanctus even when it had become a nullity under the empire ; cs.
Pliny Epp. i 23, 1.

ιιι. podibus...alnls: slaves, who had just arrived from abroad for
sale in the Roman market, were placed on the dealer’s block (in catasta
