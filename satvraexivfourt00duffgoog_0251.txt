NOTES. 187

‘to play a trick'; this avoids the tautology. 0111: is a gladiator,
perhaps named after the country of his birth.

raa. poma was a scallold of wood, erected in the amphitheatre
or at other shows, to produce certain stage ellects; it could be
heightened or lowered by machinery: cf. Sen. Epp. 88, aa machinatores,
qui pegmata per resurgentia excogitant. Our ‘pageant' is derived
from ia The putri here mentioned may be actors (so of acrobata
Mart. v ra, 4 septem..pueros levat vel octo); or possibly Cupids who
were raised to the roof by help of the machine at some point of the
spectacle. velana seems to be used first in this passage for velo.

123. macne: the priests of Bellona were so called, because of
the frantie excitement displayed in their ritual: cf. Lucani 565 quos
sectis Bellona laceras Ι saeva nawen Juv. applies the word also to
the Galli or priests of Cybele (a, rra); Martial applies antheus, entheatus
to both (xii 57, 113 xi84‚ 4).

oestro, ‘frenzy’: so thyenes is used for Bacchic inspiration‚ and
then metaphorically as in Lucri 922 am' Ι percussit thyrso laudis
spes magna meum cor.

126. tomum Bntanno: this is a reference to the esseda or
scythed chariots in which the Britons used to fight: they ran out upon
the pole in battle: cf. Caes. Ball. Gall. iv 33 par temonem percurrere
consuerint.

ray. excidet, ‘will be hurled.' The name Arviragus, used by
Shakespeare in Cymbeline for a British prince, must be taken, indirectly.
fromlrere.

That the fisb, though caught off Picenum, came from a distant
country, is proved by its hostile appearance.

128. erectae fn terra nudae: a difficult phrase, because of the
acc. terga. in, followed by the aec, should mean ‘against,’ so that
stades are probably the laterai fins. The fins are called sudes to give a
military sound to the description.

129. Fabricius is one of Veiento's names. In a fragment of
Statius, quoted by the Schol. on l· 94, he is called Fabius Veiento;
but the text is sound: Statius means thatin the German war Veiento's
strategy (heis called prudens 1. 113) was worthy of Q. Fabius Maximus,
the hero whose inaction foiled Hannibal.

130. The Emperor, as president of the Council, now asks the
different members of it for their sententia. (fuld senseat ‘whatho yon
