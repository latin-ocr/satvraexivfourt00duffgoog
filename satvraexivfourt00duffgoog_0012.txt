contain a brief account of the Manuscripts and Scholia,
based upon personal study of the material.

The Text is based upon F. Biicheler’s last edition (189 3),
which will always be memorable as giving the first full and
trustworthy account of the readings of P(the codex Pithoe-
anvr), incomparava the best of the multitude os extant Mss
Yet P has many errors3 and in a number os passages,
especially in the later satires, where Blicheler retains its
reading, I have felt unable to follow him, while I have
occasionally retained the reading os P where he discards it

My knowledge of P is derived entirely from the labours
os others—Biicheler’s edition, R. Beers Spio'legt'um, and
the two sac-simile pageS, one added by Beer to his book,
the other published by E. Chatelain in his Palograpta
des Clossiques Latias (ltbroison 10). Much may be learned
by study of these two pages.

For the interpolated uss. (o), to which class all complete
uss. except P belong, Ι have studied all the collations ⁴
accessible to me, especially those contained in Jahn’s larger
edition (1851) and in Hosius' Apparatus Criticus od Iuve-
nalem5 and, besides examining other specimens of this
class, I have collated three early Mss. which had not
previously been used by editors.

The first of these, oi the 9th century, is in the British
Museum (15,600 Addo. It isa good specimen of its
class, with blunders os its own but agreeing in certain
cases with P against other uss: thus it reads fictus

(5, 7o); sabito (6, 65) 3 Est pretium curae (6, 474); lrt'cte
lricy (6, 565), Haec (7, 41) 3 Nullo quippe modo (72 100)3
quid do (7, 165) 3 prauam (8, 33) ; ffudri (10, 78) 3 pallidos
ori(ro, 82) ; sapiat qui (11, 81); currunt (12, 77). These
are the chief exceptions to the rule that the readings inserted
by the corrector in the text or margin of P, or those found
