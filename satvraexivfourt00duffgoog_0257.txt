abiecerit. For the second sense, cf. Juv. a, 16 hunc ego satis Ι imputo
(I throw the blame for him on fate); Tac. Hist. ii 31 illi initiam belli
nemo imputabat. Cicero often uses asn'gnare in the latter sense.

rex is constantly used in the sense of ‘great man, patron’: see
n. to 1, 136. Virro, the great man of this satire, is generally referred
to as ipse or dominus, again as rex l. ¹30·

17. terna...su101sa= a common custom was to have three lecti,
each with three places, round a square table, the fourth side being
left unoceupied for the convenience of' services each guest had a
culcita (often called pulvillus) on which he rested his left elbow. For a
different arrangement of the table, see n. to 3, 82. ’

Trebius is to have the worst place at table: he is to be inens in inre

vacuo is part of the predicate.

cessam: the historic tense where the principal verb (alt) is primary,

theatra tota reclamant; (a) by primary tenses, eg. Cic. pro Flacco rr

more usual. For consecution of tenses after an ordinary perfect, cf.
Classical Review iii p. 6 foll.

18. uua murus, ‘let us have your company.’

votorum summa, ‘the height of your ambition' is attained; est

19. Trebius, the dependant, whose adventures are described
throughout the satire, can require nothing further and has sufficient
motive for all bis exertions. One of the principal duties of a client
was to rise early in order to call on (salutare, mane domi vellere) his
patron. Martial is full of complaints on this head: after he bad
quitted Rome for Spain, he writes to Juv. (xii 18, 13 about ror ab.)
