. in the middle. The writing was in columns (ceillier, paginae), like our
newspapers, but the length of the roll, lrom top to bottom, was only a
traction oi its length irom side to side. Such a roll had generally a
parchment cover (membrana). But about this time, a different material
and different shape came into use. The material was mnnbrana, the
skin oi an animal, and the torm resembled that oi our books, which was
always used hythe Romans for writing letters. This parchment was
much stronger and more durable thau papyrus, and could be written upon
on both sides As pagina is used lor the column in the papyrus roll, so
tabella is used lor the page of the parchment boolr. In Martial's
Apophoreta (book xiv) where presents are arranged in pairs, to be raffled
sor, one being valuable and the other not, books oi parchment and
papyrus rolls come alternately3 there is no doubt that the former were
more valuable. Cf. Mart-i r, 3 hos ente qnos artat brevibus niembrana
tabellis3 id. xiv 184-192.

(Friedl. supposes that Juv. refers here, uot toa parchment book, but
to tablets covered with parchment, which were certainly used ior rough
dralts: ci. Mart. xiv 7 pugillares membranei. esse puta ceras, licet
haec membrana vacetur: ldelebis, quotiens scripta novare voles3 and
Quintilian (x 3, 3¹) recommends persons with wealr sight to write
their oratorical exercisas on membrana rather than wax tablets. And
this is more probable if-what is not quite certain-parchment was
still a rare and costly material.)
