172 JUVENAL, 111. ¹

urbe imminens foro aedificatur. The Tullianum was a dungeon added
to this prison by Servius Tullius.

Juv. clearly implies that there were other prisons at Rome in his
time. Where these were is not certainly known; but it is probable that
the barracks of the praetorian and urban cohorts were used for this
purpose; cf. 6, 561 castrorum in carcere. Cl. also Trajan odPlin. 57‚n
vinctus mitti od praefectos praetorii mei debet, which suggests that the
prefects had prisons at their disposa1= though it will be remembered
that Paul, who was sent thus to Rome (62 Ant), was allowed ‘to abide
by himself with the soldier that guarded him’ (Acts 28, 16).

Ι

315-322. But Ι must be going. ercnever you visit Aquinum, I
will come from Cumae to see you ond to lzear your sollres.

315. canaan sc. migrandi.

317. multi: for the quantity, see n. to ergo 1, 3.

vhgaadnutt: cf.8, 153.

319. tuo: Juv. was a native of Aquinum in Latium. It appears
from the text that the chief deities worshipped there were Diana and '
Ceres Helvina: for the inscription to Ceres at Aquinum, generally
referred to Juv., see Introd. p. xix.

320. veatram=Aquinatium3 here, as always, vester must be dis·
tinguished from tuus.

3²1· nl pudet illus: it is not suggested that the satircs are afraid
of criticism but that they might desire a more distinguished critic.

322. auditor: Biich. has now (1893) gone back to adiutor which
he removed in 1886 on Beer’s report of P's reading; but his note admits
that the first hand of P may have written auditor, which is found as a
correction of adiutor in several MSS. This being so, the Μὴ which is
better in point of meaning, should be kept. It is hard to sec how
Umbr. could help the satires except by listening to them; cf. Mart.
xii pref. sl quidest enim quod in libellis meis placeat, dictavit auditor5
Ovid ex Ponl. iv a, 3 5 excitat orrdllor clodium.

Although reciting poets are one of the chief terrors of Rome (cf. 1. 9),
Umbr. is willing to listen to his friend’s satires

caligatus, ‘with thick boots’; there is no metaphor here from
nilitary service; Umbr. hints that his plain rough dress may not find
tltrour with J αν. ’s Muse.
