suinai, the reading of the inferior uss, is apparently the correction oi
someone whose zeal for accuracy was stronger thau his imagination.

tubera, ‘truffleu’ called tubera terrae 14, yand Mart. xiii 503
their growth was thought to be stimulated by thunder: cf. Pliny Nat.
Hist. xix 37 de tuberibus iaec traduntur...: cum fuerint imbres autum·
“ nales ac tonaima crebra, tunc nasci‚...tenerra'ma autem verno esse: he
mentions a kind of ruber called in Greece κεραύνιον, which indicates the
same heliel. ”

117. iactent...er morea, ‘shall add a dish to the dinner’:
cp. ια, 56.

118. sini habe...‚ ‘keep your corn io yoursell' 3 1 don’t want it;
in this phrase the pronora, tibi, sibi etc„ regularly precedes the verb:
seen.io3, 188.

Alledius, an unknown gourmaud, is represented as not only
gluttonous but selfish; he considers the corn-supply from Africa ot
no importance, iithe truffles do not fail. Africa, Sicily, and Egypt,
were the chief sources from which the huge idle population oi Rome
was led; see n. to messoribus 8, 117.

119. dirime Βαναία-τ* stop producing corn!

dum, ‘provided that)

rno. The motor is properly the arranger ol the table3 here and
rr. 136 heis also the carver. who is elsewhere called scissor or carptor
(Petron. 363 Juv. 9, 110).

Trebius is a mere looker-on and gets nothing to eat, which is the just

· vocati Ι et positum cst nobis m'l here praeter aprums...et nihil inde datram
ατη· tantum spectavimus omnes; Lucian de Marc. Cond. τό (os a Greek
philosopher dining in a great Roman house) εἰς τὴν ἀτιμοτάτην γωνίαν
ἐξωσθεὶς κατάκεισαι μάρτυς μόνον τῶν παραφερομένων.

chironomunta, ‘gesticulating’t owing to the importance os the
arms in ancient dancing, χειρονομεῖν or bracchia neovcrc is often
¹synonymous with ὀρχεῖσθαι or saltare: ¹thus Herodotus can say in the
famous story oi Hippocleides (vi ¹²9) τοῖσι σκέλεσι ἐχειρονόμησε where
the first part oi the word has clearly lost its meaning. Similarly
saltantem here need noi imply much, li any, motion oi tna mamers

legs
ronan, ‘in air.'
