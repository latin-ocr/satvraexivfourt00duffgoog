The distance between Tentyra and Ombos is considerably over
a hundred miles; but modern Egyptologists (cs. Maspero's Daren os
Civilssanan p. aon n. 4) believe that Juv.’s Ombi is not Ombos but the
town called Pampanis by the Romans and Pt-Nubit by the Egyptians
(now Negadeh). This is much neuter Tentyra.
