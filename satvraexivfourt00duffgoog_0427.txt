NOTES. 363

ιι. egregius is adv. of the comparative ; a form not elsewhere
found ι there is no possible ambiguity here, or it would not be used.

The expression is somewhnt irregular for eo egregius cenot quo
miserim est.

v 13· cueume is syntactically'an adj. joined by et to the other adj.
miserrimus. ram...ru1na, ‘the falling building already letting in the
light’: the man’s lortunes are compared to a house about to sall and so
dilapidated that light enters through the cracks: so Waller ‘The soul’s
dark cottage, battered and decayed, Ι lets in new light thro’ chinks that
time has made,’ ie. the old are wiser. cf. a, 78 (to a noble, wearing
a transparent garment) Cretico, perluces; Plaut. Rudens 101 vz'llam
integundam intellego totam mihi,· Ι nam nunc perlucet ea quom cribrum
erebrius. mino is not ‘the iall' but ‘the falling house’: cs. 10, 107.

14. interea, ie. until the crash comes.

metus, ‘flavours,’ i.e. dainty dishes.

omnia: three at least of the elements are meante earth, air, and
water are ransacked for bensts, birds, and fishes3 cf. Seneca quoted on
59 95·

15· insonus sl erumnas, ‘a carelul scrutiny will show that...’; lor
the idiomatic subj. ol the ond pers, see n. to 3, 102. So in Horace
(Sat. ii a, ι 3) the gourmand prefers a pescock to a fowl, because it costs
more. cf. Sen. Not. Quaest. iv 13, 4 luxuriae nihil placere potest nesi
comni.

16. ementur, perh. ‘will have to be bought': but the fut, read by
P alone, is peculias after iuvant: emetur (l. 36) after the imperative is
normal; and it seems possible that the fut. here is a copyist’s error due
to the fut. below.

18. ‘By pawning silver dishes οι breaking up the bust oi a mother.’
oppositis, sc. pignori: cl. vaso novissima 6, 356. imagines were made
oi metal as well as of marble; in this case theson breaks up an imago
ol his mother, presumably ol silver. For necta used of metal, cf.
frangebat poeula, 1. 102. Some take fracta as an epithet, ‘cracked,' and
supply opposita again with imagine: but in that casea thing of value is
coupled with something worthless.

19. quemme. nummis, 400 sesterces (τά). Seneca speaks ola
single meal costing one thousand times as much, Epp. 95, 41 quiiestcena
sumptuosa flagitiosius et equestrem censum consumente? For a mullet
costing Α 50, see n. to 4, 15.
