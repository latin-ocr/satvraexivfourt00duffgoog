458 JUVENAL, xvr.

were osten given with torques and armillae; and the three together were
called dona.

The sentence and the satire here break off abruptly. The satire is
obviously unfinished. There is also extemal evidence which proves
this: see Introd. pp. xlv and xlvi. It follows that part of the bookis
lost, though the amount lost isa matter oi conjecture. A ‘book’
(volumen) oi Latin poetry may contain as many as r‚ooo lines:
few, except those oi Lucretius, exceed this number. This mutilated
book contains 814 lines; there are 990 lines in the rst book, 661
in the ond, 668 in the grd, and 704 in the 4th. ssus it is already
longer than three of the books, but considerably shorter than the ist.

ADDITI'ONAL NOTES.

1, 149. omne tu praecipiti vitians nous: Mr Richards‘ explana·
tiori of this phrase is strikingly confirmed by an expression of Seneca,
(Diol. iii y, 4) vitianum natrrra precluus, where the context shows the
meaning to he that many vices are in a state of unstable equilibrium:
they cannot remain where they are but must go on till they reach their
extreme point. This is exactly what Juv. means.

3, 216. conterat inpensae: as the meaning, which inpensas
apparently has here, is not common, another instance may be quoted
from the book oi portents (Prodigiorum Liber) compiled from Livy by
Julius Obsequens: 28 [87] Tarracinae, sereno, nouis uelum fulnu'ue†
exanimatum iu aquam derectum, et † impensus ournes quae ibi erant,
ignis absumpsit: part oi the text is corrupt, but the meaning of impensae
is clearly ‘materials’ oi some kind which formed the ship’s cargo.

6, ²95· paupertas Romana: this striking phrase may take its
origin from a very similar passage in Seneca's Epistles (87, 41: the
subject is the iutility, for practica] purposes, of the syllogisms ot' the
philosophioal schools which prove that wealth is not a ‘good '): his
[interrogationibus sumtu] effecturi, ut populus Romnum paupertatem,
fimdamenturu et causam imperii sui, requiratur laudet, divitias autem
suas timeat? ut cogitet has se apud victos reperisse, hinc ambitum et

largitiones et tuntultus in urbere sanctissimam temperantissimomque
inrupisse? ¹
