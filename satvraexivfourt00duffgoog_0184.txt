120 Juvuunu, 1.

eg, vii 64 qui tonsor sacros tota notissimus urbe Ι etpost hoc dooaeinoe
munercsactuseques. ¹

25 isa parody oi Virg. Ecl. 1, 28 candidior postquam tondenti barba
cadebat. The l. recurs ro‚oo6. For the Roman way of treating the heard,
see nn. to 6, 1053 8, 166. Observe that Juv. speaks of his youth as
already past.

26. canopus (Κάνωβος) was a city at the western mouth of the
Nile. Crispinus was born there and came to Rome as a seller of salt·
fish. He became a knight (princeps equitnm 4, 32) and a member of
Domitian’s privy council. Martial speaks more savourably (vii 99, viii
48), as he naturally would, of the emperor's favourite. Juv. has ‚a
remarkable dislilre of Egypt and Egyptians: see Introd. p. xxxvii.

²7· reuocante, ‘hitching up.‘ ,

28, ²9· It is generally supposed, on the evidence ol this passage
alone, that lighter rings were worn in summer by men of sashion; but
the latin does not warraut this inierence. Juv. only says that Crisp. wears
a gold ring as heavy as he can carry, so heavy that in summer it malres
his fingers hot. milvum does not imply a special ring, but is only an
equivalent for aestate, ‘in summer’; cf. matutino...omomo 4, 108 where ’
the adj. merely takes the place of noane. A good parallel is afiorded by
Mart. v 19, 11 Soturnolc'cr'oe legulam misz‘sse selz‘orae...‚ where the adj.
takes the place os Saturnalibus, aud no one suggests that hals-a·pound
oi plate at the Saturnalia was disserent from half·a·pound at any other
time. An adj. (especially oi time) is employed with great freedom by
the later Latin poets‚ to express an adverbial clause. See n. to 6, 5.

49. managamma, ‘a (not ‘his ’) larger ring' ς gooomoo is used
sor the unmetrical anuli: so l. 68 and often.

3ο. iniquae...urots: cs. saevae urbis 3, 83 either the hard struggle

for lile in great cities is in the writer's mind; or perhaps iniquae is
‘unjust’3 ie. Rome rewards and honours criminals.

31· lenem, ‘steeled against it’; it means much the same os
patiens, but is stronger; cs. 7, 150.

33. plena ipso: the lectica was constructed to carry two; but
Matho is sat and needs a whole one ior himscls.

magni, ‘great' in the sense ol ‘important, highly placed‚' not
in t'he sense os ‘devoted’ ; cf. 4, 74, and Eur. Medo 549 otyor φίλος
noth Venall's note there.

dolator: see n. to 3, 116. Tbere caunot well be a reterencehere to
