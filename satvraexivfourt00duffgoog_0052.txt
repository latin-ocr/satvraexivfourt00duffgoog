INTRODUCTION.

IV. THE MANUSCRIPTS.

Juvenal, in his character as a moralist, was much read in the
Middle Ages: there were probably few large monastic libraries
which did not contain acopyof the satires3 and some contained
more than one. Two MSS, one of the 9th‚ the other ol the roth
century, now in the Library ol Trinity College, Cambridge, both
belonged formerly to St Augustine’s Monastery at Canterbury.
Hence the number os Mss. still extant is very large; there is
probably no classical author ol whom we possess so many. Beer
had counted 120 in the libraries os Austria, Germany, and France.
No complete MS. is older than the ninth century; and there are
few ol that antiquity. They are all divided into two classes,
according to the recension of the text they contain. But the
better class is now represented by only one complete MS. This
is preserved in the Library ol the Medical School at Montpellier.
lt is sometimes called Codex Montepessulanus, but more often
Pithoeanus, from the fact that it once belonged to Pierre Pithou
whose name is written upon it. Pithou was a F rench scholar
and jurist, who published in 1585 an edition of Juvenal and
Persius based upon his ms. The abbreviation P⁴is commonly
used to denote this MS. and its readings. It dates from the
ninth century; and though little, if at all, older than some of
the other MSS, it has no rival in merit and occupies a class by
itself. All the other MSS. belong to the second and inferior
class: they (and their readings) are denoted in critical editions
by the symbolo. The earliest editions of Juvenal, as those of
Ferrara (1474) and Louvain (1475), were printed from MSS. os
the interpolated class ; nor was the value ol P fully understood
until the edition of Otto Jahn, published in 1851.

P has been corrected at different dates by several different
hands, which cannot be distinguished with certainty. The
readings of the correctors are indicated by the symbol p.
The endeavour of the corrector was generally to substitute
