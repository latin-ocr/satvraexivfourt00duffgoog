422 JUVENAL, xrv.

ol a virtue: cf. Plaut. Mil. Glor. 624 siquidem tc quicquam quod frixis
pudet, Ι ηἰΙιὶΙ amas, umbra es amantum magis quam mator.

rra cum, ‘since' ’ >

111. nee: the negative contained in this word belongs entirely to
dubr'e, ‘iu no doubtful terms?

112. tutela, ‘guardian’: the word is often applied by the poets to

persons and things: cl. Hor. Epp. i 1, 103 (to Maecenas) rerum tutela
mearum Ι cum sis. Itis regularly used for the ‘figure-bead’ ol a sbr'p,
which generally represented some guardian deity.

1¹3· tortunas, ‘wealth’r aconstant sense ol the plur. ε fortuna ol
P, which Buch. keeps, isa mere slip due to the repeated s.

114. The apples ol the Hesperides and the golden fleece ol the
Colchians in Pontus were both guarded by a sleepless dragon, according
to the legend. ⁴

hunc de quo loquor is any avarus. The additional lact is that the
miser is thoughtagood hand at increasing his wealthaswellaslreeping it.

116. quippe, ‘loa'

fabrlsiseither dat. of advantage or abl. absol. Ι

117. sed...modo is a parenthesis, quatitytng the previous statement
by adding that such men are unscrupulous in the race for wealth: cl.
Hor. Epp. i 1, 65 rem sacius, rem, Ι sr' possis, recte, si non, quocunque
madorem.

118. The metaphor of fabrus is continued: so we say ‘to strike
while the iron is hot.'

119. ‘Well then, a father also (as well as the common people)
thinks a miser a happy man' anlml, ‘in their mind‚’ a locative
common with certain adjectives, such as aeger and dubius, and some
verbs, eg. penfflrc.

If the text is sound, there is some carelessness in the expression
bere: it is difficult to determine whether the relative clauses which
follow avaros, have pater as antecedent, or form the subject to hmatur.
Il credit were preceded by a relative, or it l. 119 were removed, there
would be no difficulty. It seems necessary to the sense that humatur
should be a principal, and not a dependent, verb. The simplest remedy
'a to put a semi-colon sor a comma aster avaros (so C. F. Hermann):
but the expression still remains abrupt. Madvig read mirantur and
putant, on the authority os the inlerior Mss.

rra. pergant: peragant ol P, which Biich. keeps, isunintelligible.
mus, ‘way os lite‘: this word is generally used together with, and

coverned by, the verb sequi.
