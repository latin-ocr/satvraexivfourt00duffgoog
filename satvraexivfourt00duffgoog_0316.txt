488. 11011111 may be either her own property or a public parh3 see
n. to 1, 75. .

489. Inuoco...lenue: the Iseum, or temple ol Isis, in the Campus
was notorious as a place of assignations: cf. Ovid Ars i 77 nec stege
linigerae Memphitica templa iuvencae ,· Ι multas illa facit quodfm't ipsa
Iovi. The Romans constantly confused Isis with Io: see n. to 1. 526.

490. For the cruelty of Roman ladies to their maids, cs. ovid
Am. i 14, 16 ornatrix tulo corpore semper erat. laerte meos saepe est
oculos ornata, nec anquene 1 bracchia derepta saucia fecit ncu3 Mart.
ii 66 unus de toto peccaverat orbe coenarum Ι anulus, e'ueerla non bene
fixus acu. Ι hoc focinus Lalage speculo quo viderat ulla est, Ιετ cecidit
saevis icta Plecusa comis. We must imagine the mistress, mirror in
hand, criticising the growth of the structure on her head and orderiug
blows to be showered on the maid. Seneca (Dial. x 12, 3) shows that
men were no more easily pleased: illos otiosos vocas, quibus apud
tonsorem multae leorae transmittuntur,...dum de siugulis capillis e'n

’ consilium itur? (cf. l. 497)...quomodo excandescunt, si quid ex iuba

sua decisum est, siquid extra ordinem iacuit, nisi omnia in anulos suos
reciderunt?

491. Psecas: like Plecusa above, this maid is Greek3 the name-
0ccurs in Ovid Met. iii ¹7² as borne by one os Diana's nymphs.

scutica.

494. admisit: seen. to 13, 1.

1110, ‘in this,' ‘here’

495. Juv. insinuates that the lady punishes her maid only because
she is not satisfied with her own beauty.

With laevum, ‘on the lest side,’ understand crinem.

496. For orbem, cl. Mart. quoted on l. 490.

497. The languagc is taken from the mecting os a body of magis·
trates or os the Senate. The old woman, who had been maid to the
lady’s mother, ‘sits as assessor,’ est in censium see n. to 3, 162 and
cl. Pliny Epp. vi 11, o recepta cognitio est ,· sui e'n consilio. She, like the
peinceps senatus, is asked to state her opinion first: she used to stick the
hairpins hersels, but is now given the work of apportioning wool 10
the other women ; cl. libraria l. 476. materna, sc. ancilla. admotu
huie: cf. Sen. Epp. 11, gad ostium admotum ibid. uu, ις, omnes servos
