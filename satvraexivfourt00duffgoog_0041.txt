INTRODUCTION. Α xxxi

Furtber, the clement of dialogue which we have seen to be
essential to the older satura, has almost disappeared. There

is a fragment of dialogue in the first satire; the whole of the
ninth is a real dialogue; and the third retains something of the

ancient form, though it is in fact amonologue of three hundred
lines put into the mouth of Umbricius. But generally Juvenal
himself is the only speaker.

Some characteristics, however, of the saturo still survive. lt
was originally a succession of isolated scenes ; and what 'better
description could be given of much of Juvenal’s work? ln the
sixth satire, especially, the want of connexion and even of ,
consistency between the different topics of which it is composed‚
is so striking that some editors suppose that each paragraph
must have been written independently and the whole strung
together with little regard for sequence or coherence. It must
be allowed that Juvenal is remarkably indifferent to what

’ Quintilian· calls oeconomia, the proper arrangement and dis-
position of his matter. Hardly any satire, except the third,
has a consistent and satisfactory framework; in many he
seems to have forgotten the beginning before he reaches the
end3 and in nearly all, the attentive reader is puzzled by
irrelevant digressions, sudden transitione, and the unexplained
absence of topics which he has promised to treat of. He is a
marked example of the fault of his age, the tendency to sacrifice
the whole to the parts. lt is possible, however, that he would
have pleaded in excuse for these faults the traditional freedom

· of satural.

Thus there are great differences of form between the satires
of Juvenal and those of his predecessors. But in matter the
difference is not less marked. Lucilius ‘lashed the town’; but
he also discoursed on innumerable subjectS, from his ow,¹
joumeys to the anomalies of Latin grammar. And Horace
who duly carried out his own precepts, declares that the satiris

¹ Some of the minor external characteristics of satura, eg. the usti
' of diminutives, are fully preserved in Juvenal. He also shows mhi&
greater variety ar the end of the line than the epic poets do.
