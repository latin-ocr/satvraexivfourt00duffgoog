334 Juvenum, x.

55. las est, ‘it is allowable, permissible’; cl'. 1, 58, 131; 6, 6283
10, 257: such things as power and eloquence are recognised as proper
objects os prayer, which can be asked for aperto voto (Pers a, 7) : there
are objects os prayer which cannot be avowed; cf. Seu. Epp. ιο, 5

quanta denuntra est hommum! turpissima vota dis insusurrant: si
quis admoverit aurem, contabescant.

genua incerare demum: this refers to the custom, common in
antiquity, oi writing a prayer or vow on awax lablet and placing it
on a temple wall or the knees of a divine image; such auctiva tabella
is generally mentioned as a sign of gratitude for prayer auswered, but
was also used in the way here described3 cs. rr, 100. The knees

' were constantly grasped, or appealed to, by suppliants. Hence the
Honreric τοῦτο θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται (await the decision oi heaven).

57. mergit, ‘they are wrecked by...'; the verb is active, as 13, 8.

58. pagina honorum=tituli3 see n. to 1, 130. pagr’na, lit.
‘column‚’ not ‘page': see n. to 7, 23.

descendunt statuae, ‘down corne the statues’: the order of words
should be kept. See 11. to 8, 18. It was a regular thing ior the

imagines cius coram detrahi et ibidem solo afflrgri iuberet.

59, 60. Even the chariot and horses of a triumphal statue are not
spared. caballis: cf. 3, 1183 but the word seems to have no satirica]
purpose here; it may already have been the colloquial equivalent lor
equus, which it finally displaced in the Romance languages, as the French
cheval shows. The number ol statues erected to Sejanus was enormous:
the senate voted the erection of one in the theatre of Pompey (Tac. Anu.
iii 72, 5) ; in the camp oi every army, except in Syria, his statue was
found by that of the emperor (Suet. Tib. 48).

62. adoratum, ‘worshipped' in the literal sense ; cf. Dio Cass. lviii
4, 3 καὶ τέλος καὶ τοῖς εἰκόσιν αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ καὶ ruissoli Τιβερίου ἔθυον.

63. Seianus: L. Aelius Sejanus, the son os a Roman knight, born
at Vulsinii in Etruria, became prefectos the praetorian guards, and
finally the alter ego os Tiberius; at last the emperor discovered his
treachery, and his utter ruin sollowed; he was executed October 18,
ΑΔ), 31. Seneca also quotes him as the chinel example oi the instability

of great power, Diol. ix 11, 11 honoribus summis functas es: sammua
