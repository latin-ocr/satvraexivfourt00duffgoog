It has been suggested that Shakespeare refers to this passage in
Hamlet‘s reply to Polonius (Act 11, Scene ol: ‘the satirical rogue says
here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their
eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum, and that they have a
plentilul lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though 1 most powersully and potently believe, yet l hold it not honesty
to have it thus set down’ Swilt takes some traits from Juv. for his own
much more repulsive picture os the Struldbrugs (Gallivvr's Τ ravels
