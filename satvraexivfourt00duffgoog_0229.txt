nores. 165

not elsewhere have this o short: Seneca, in his tragedias, begins iambic
lines with petendi, solvendi etc.

son1psum...‚ ‘yes, and the sickness itself was produced...’ One
step in the argument is omitted, ie. that good digestion depends on sleep.

²33· inperfectus is unusual in this sense: concoctos or consectus
are the usual words ior ‘digested’r but cf. Celsus iv ²3 quitquid
assumptum cst (has been eaten), imperfectum protinus reddunt (intestina).

235.. admittunt, ‘make sleep possible,' not ‘let sleep in'3 cf.
non admittentia murrum 5, 69.

dormitur: ior the impera, ci. Mart. xii 68, 6 otia me somnusque
iuvant, quae magna negavit Ι Roma milri: redeo si vigilatur ethic.
In this epigram, which was written in Spain, Mart. is not complaining
of the noises in Rome bnt of the necessity oi rising early to perform
the salutatio: so x 74: but elsewhere he often speaks of the street-
cries and noises which made sleep impossible: ci. esp. xii 57.

236. nudarum mamlius: the raeda was a heavy four-wheeled
carriage used by travellers. Their noise was troublesome by night,
because no vehicles except litters were allowed to pass through the

Nstreets oi Rome ior ten hours atter sunrise; an exception was made
m the case oi materials tor public buildings; see ll. 254 foll arto..
inflexu: when Rome was rebnilt aiter the great fire oi 64 ab, the
streets were made less narrow and winding than they had been beiore ;
but, owing to the hills on which itis built, the city always has been
and still is inferior in convenience to other European capitals.

237. mutis, ‘blocked.' convicta must be understood oi the men
who accompany the ntandra: “the omnibus, as Miss La Creevy
protested, swore so dreadfully that it was quite awful to hear ir”
Niclrolas Nickleby.

238. muso is supposed to mean the emperor Claudius, whose full
name is Ti. Claudius Drusus Caesar. Suetonius (Claud. 8 and 33) says
that he constantly fell asleep aiter dinner and sometimes on the judgment·
seat. But it is strange that the name Drusus, which was borne by so
many oi the imperial family, should be used to designate Claudius ;
also the fut. (eripient) is inappropriate. Hence there is much proba·
bility in Speyer’s conjecture surdo. If Druso is kept, it seems better
to suppose, with the Scholiast‚ a reference to a contemporary ol Juv.,
unknown to us: ci. Procula l. 203.

vitulisque mannis: ci. Pliny Nat. Hist. 'nr aa toi thius ammam
nullum animal gravem somno premitur. .

²³9· mium, ‘a social duty,' eg. a call: ci. 5, m &²033 ‘⁶
