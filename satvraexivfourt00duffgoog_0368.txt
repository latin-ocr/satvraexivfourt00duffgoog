304 ’ Juvnum, v111.

communis semus represents our ‘common sense,' something opposed
to a loltier but less practical wisdom, eg. Sen. de Bau. i 12, 3 nemo tam
stultus cst ut rnuundus sit ne cui...mittut uestimenta aestivd bruma,
hiber-na solstitio: sit in beneficio sensus communes: tempus, locum
observet. See n. to 7, 218.

74. fortuna, ‘rank’3 cs. ιι, 176; Sen.Dial.iv21‚ 7 nonne vides
ut nmiorem quamque fortunam maior ira comitetur?

76. laudls is governed by nihil, and denotes the good action itsell
as well as the praise won by it.

77. ne...ruant...tecta may be transl. ‘or the roof may fall in....'

78 is very abrupt as a separate statement. 1 therefore follow Beer
(Spicilcgr'uut p. 73) in changing the stop after columm's to a comma, and
reading desederet lor desederat: a variant, discinderet, in the margin ol
l‘, gives some confirmation to this reading; and the passage gains
decidedly by the coordination os the two similes,

(Mr Lendrum would keep the text, explaining the abruptness by
the lact that l. 78 is proverbial; he compares Aristoph. Wusps 1291 siro
νῦν ἐξηπάτησεν ἡ χάραξ τὴν ἄμπελον.)

νὶᾱιῑαε...ιι]]ιιοε; see n. to 6, 150: this metaphoris constant in
Latin: the elm is here called uulua because the vine has fallen from it,
just as the plane is called uidua by Martia] (iii 58, 3) and caelebs hy
Horace (Curm. ii 15, 4), because it was never used to train the vine
upon: for vziiua means both ‘maid' and ‘widow’3 cl. 4, 4.

79. esth: but estu l. 164 where the o is in arsis.

81. rel, here, and often in Plautus, an iambus, isin Lucretius
always a spondeo or one long syllable: see Munro on Lucr. i 688:
the form occurs only here in Juv. and is very rare in verse aster
Lucr. ε fidti occurs 13, 6.

Phalnrls is the tyrant of Agrigentum, famous sor the brazen bull in
which he roasted his victims alive ; cs. 6, 486. ·

82. admoto: this verb is regularly used os applying means of
compulsion: cf. Hor. Curm. iii 21, 13 tormentum iugenio adfurum
Livy xxvii 43, 3 metus toruuutorum admotus.

83. pudori, ‘honour'; again 16, 34, but a rare sense of the word:
M. quotes Pliny Epp. ii 4, a dubus sauram defuncti pudoremque sus·
capture, where the two words seem almost synonymous.

84. vivendi ceusu, ‘what makes lise worth living’3 cf. 11, 11
and Pliny Eup. i η, 3 plurimas uiuendi causas habentem, optimam

cmcuuttum, uptz'ruam samam, maximum auctoritatem.

35· Pssfl'l, ‘l's dead already'3 perleet, not present.
