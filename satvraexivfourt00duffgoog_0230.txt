240. super ora: cl. Sen. Epp. 80, 8 Mem de ritis licet duas quos

²4¹· So the elder Pliny always read or wrote while being carried
about Rome in his litter, and rebuked his nephew for walking instead of
following his example (Pliny Epp. iii 5, 16).

obiter again 6, 481.

242. fenestra: ci. specularibus 4, or. Discoveries at Pompeii
and elsewhere show that windowglass was already known and used
in the 1st century ; but it is probable that talc (lapis specularis) is the

’ material meant in both these passages ; it was cheaper sor a long time
and served to exclude the sun as well as to admit light.

243. umen, although he has taken no trouble.

noble, ie. pauperibus: in English, ‘sor' must be supplied at the
