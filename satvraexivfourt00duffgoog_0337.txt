Apollo on the Palatine. There wasa second library in another temple,
also on the Palatine, built by Livia to Augustus and known as the nomem
templum cs. Mart. xii 3,7 (to his book) iure tuo veneranda novi pete
limina templi Ι reddito Pierio sunt ubi templa chor03 from this it appears
that the libraryin the latter was dedicated to the Muses. Thus Juv.
may refer here to both tbe great public libraries: the poet, in order to
court his patron, turns his back on thern and their presiding deities.

to Homer: cs. Sedigitus ap. Gell. xv ²4 decimum addo causa antiqui·
later Ennium.

4ο. rodiam see n. to 3, 93 sor the constr, cf. 6, 470. Meculonio
is the reading oi P which Biich. keeps: he supposes this to be some
private house which could be used, and was used, lor the purpose;
this being the general custom, until Hadrian built an Athenaeum ior
recitations· That it was unusually generous in arich man to lend ln's
own house sor the purpose, appears from Pliny Epp. viii 12, a domum
suam recitantibus praebet. Juv.'s readers may have been as familiar
with Maculo's house as with Hispulla's bulk (ιο, 11), though both
allusions tall flat to us.

On the other hand, it is clear from the Scholiast's note, that he read
maculosas3 und some edd. prefer this (or maculonsos Bywater), though the
epithet is unexampled of a house. But it should be ohserved that this
involves a further departure from P; ior baeo (l. 41) requires that one
definite house should be mentioned here. Consequently‚ ii maculosas
is read, ac, the reading of the inferior mss, must be substituted sor haec.

41. longe cannot stand for diu, though Ioergrmr sometimes does: .
it means ‘at a distance’ and is to be taken with domus: cf. Mart. iii 58,
51 rus hoc vocari debet an domm longe? (a town-house out of town).
This connexion of adv. with noun is due to the absence, in Latin, of
a pres. partic. of esse. The want oi an article is a further complication,
so that the adv. mayhave to represent anoun in any case, nunc standing
for ol νῦν ὄντες, τούς νῦν ὄντας etc: cf. Tac. Hist. i ro polam (his public
lite, τὰ δημόσια) leudomarum male arrdiebant ; Ovid Met. i 19 (os the
primeval chaos) frigida pugnabant caltilr's,...se'ne pondere l=roir ἄνευ
βάρους otoo) habentia pondus. ,

servire, ‘to be at your disposal': so, ol acountry-seat, Mart. x 30,
28 o rbnitores vilisique felices! Ι dominis parantur (are bought by their
owners) etta, serviunt vobis.

42. sollicitae, ia of a besieged city: portua must oi course mter
ro a city. The house is securely barricaded‚ as ii to present uhtiutiffir
