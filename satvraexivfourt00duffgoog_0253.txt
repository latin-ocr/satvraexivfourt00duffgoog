NOTE8. 189

in arce ῑγναηηιιες Senec. controv. i 7, 16 oidifila'um in arce (=rvpov·
νοῢντα εἶδον τὸν ntor).

146. attentos: see n. to l. 77.

147. The country ol the Chatti was the modern Hesse, the
Sycambri lived in what is now Rhenish Prussia; for the former, cf.
Mart ii a, 5 (published in 85 or 86) frater [duereoeos nzerut't cum patre
triumphos! (ie. Vespasian and Titus together triumphed over Syria),·
quoe datur ea'c Chattis laurea, toto tua est. If Domitian fought against
the Sycambri, we have no mention of it elsewhere.

148. umquam et: so P and T: other mss. omit et: edd. generally
read ex. tamquam et is harsh lor et tarnquom, but Ι do not leel
sure that emendation is necessary.

diversis nutibus, ‘adistant quarter’ : cl. Ovid Arsi 685 iam necrus
od Priamum deherso venerat orbe, ie. from Sparta to Troy. L. trans·
lates ‘from opposite quarters': but the sing. epistula makes this less
prohable: for the meaning ol diversus, see n. to 3, 268.

149. ‘Terrified despatches had flown in headlong haste' 3 the
metaphoris from the ssight ol a terrified bird. The Schol. states that
a laurel ora ieather was lastened on despatches, one in sign of a
victory, the other ol a deleat; the latter statement is borne out to
some extent by Stat. Silo. v 1, 93 nullaque sanioso rigaretur lancea
pinna3 but this explanation is not needed here.

150-154. Such occupations were undagm'fied enough for an emperor ‚·
but Ire was better so employed than in destroying the noblest Romans.

151. Suetonius gives a list os the chief victims ol Domitian’s cruelty
(Dom. rol: they include Civica Cerealis, Salvidienus Orfitus, Acilius
Glabrio (l. 95), Salvius Cocceianus, Mettius Pompusianus (one os whose
crimes was that he carried about an atlas ll, Junius Rusticus, and
Aelius Lamia (l. 154). For his saevitia, cl. also Pliny lhneg. 48 danto
quam nuper illa immanissima belua plurimo terrore ntatnierat, cum...
num propinquorum sanguinem lanchem, num se ad clarissimorum
civium strages caedesque proferret.

¹52· antmas‚‘lives.’

153· cerdonibus: seen. to 8, 181. The conspiremus, who pntan
end to Domitian, were all of the meanest rank.

154·' coeperat: the aorist, not imperf. or pluperf., would be used
here alter postquem in classical Latin.

noculo, ‘proved his ruin'; nocere is olleo more than merois *eo
injure ',· cs. ro, 8.
