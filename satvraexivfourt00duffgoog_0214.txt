malom abollae, ‘of a greater personage’3 the phrase seems pro·
verbial, like ‘big-wig' or gros bonnet. Others explain ‘of stouter
texture( i.e. a robuster crime. Others take abollae as: philosophi ς but
that dress was not confined to philosophers: it is worn by Pegasus
(4, 76), and by such a fop and voluptuary as Crispinus (Mart. viii 48).

116. P. Egnatius Celer, born at Berytus in Phoenicia and perhaps
educated at Tarsus (but see n. to nutritus l. 117), professed the Stoic
philosophy, and in that capacity, as guide, philosopher, and friend,
was an inmate in the house of Barea Soranus, a Roman aristocrat.
Under Nero 66 Aa). Barea was accused with his daughter Servilia and
condemned under the law of nraiestas3 the evidence against him was
supplied by Egnatius. The universal detestation felt for the traitor
was satisfied 70 ab. when he was put to death under Vespasian:

deletor, ‘informer’ ; and often prosecutor too; cf. 1, 333 4, 48;
ro, 70. The power of these men and the terror they inspired were
among the worst features of the imperial rule. The term does
not occur in Augustan literature; but the practice began under Au·
gustus, who by the lex Iulia and the lex Papia Poppaea, restricted
the power ol inheritance of unmanied persons, and granted rewards
to informers (Tac. Ann. iii 283 Suet. Nero 10) qui nomen alr'cuius
deferebant ad aerarium ς the treasury then claimed the inheritance.
This mattered little; but at some unknown period, probably when
Tiberius revived the law of treason (Tac. Ann. i γα), similar provisions
were added to the lex Iulia de mar'estate; so that the informer, who
brought a successful charge of treason against any subject, was rewarded
with a fourth part of his victim’s property (Tac. Ann. iv ao). The
natural result followed ε informers swarmed, and the most trifling act or
word, which could be construed as disrespect for the monareh, passed
for treason. All emperors, however, did not treat them alike: while
Tiberius gave them needless encouragement and called them the
guardians of the laws (Tac. Ann. iv 30), Titus had them flogged in
the amphitheatra and then exiled or sold as slaves (Suet. Tit. 8); and
both Nerva and Trajan did much to suppress them (Pliny Paneg.
