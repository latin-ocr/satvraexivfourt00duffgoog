laetu is strangely used sor iactura: if the winds grant him life,
he will surrender to them his goods.

’ 34. cutura: fable represented the beaver as biting oli that part ol
his body for the sake of which he was hunted.

36. nauem: the only hiatus in this part ol the verse in Juv.

adeo...1ngusn, ‘for well aware is he of the dmg he carries in his
groin': see n. to 3, 274.

37. From the description it appears probable that Catullus wasa
merchant, what Seneca calls institor delicatarum mercium (de Bm. vi
38, 3)² it seems unlikely that he was carrying all the luxuries described
(eg. mille escariis) for his own use. ,

39. stemmatum, ie. men like Maecenas, lops and voluptuaries;
see n. to 1, 66.

40· auae...peeus, ‘other garments, of which the wool was dyed on
the sheep‘s back (ipsum) hythe quality oi the splendid pasture’: pecus
islit., the flock that bore the wool. The wool of the sheep in Baetica
had a natural tinge of a golden colour, as Martial repeatedly states, eg.
xiv 133 lacernas Baeticae. nan cst lana mihi mendax, nec mutor alima
(the vat).· Ι sic 73¹ch placeant, me nica tinxit ovis.

4¹· cunclusione, ie. the river Baetis (Guadalquiver): cf. Mart.
xii 98, 1 Baetis, ...aurea qui nitidt's vellera tinguis aquis. Seneca neatly
describes the Peneus, which had similar propertieS, as gratuitus infictor
(ie. it saves the dyer),

43. argentum, ‘silves-plate’s lances and cratera are in apposition.
mttere, ‘to throw into the sea)

44. Parthenio is said hythe Schol. to be the name of the engraver
(caelator): plate was osten named after the engraver and his name
stamped upon it (cf. Sen. Dial. ix 1, 7 argentum grave rustici patris
sinc ullo nomine artiflcQ so we read in Martial oi Gratiana (sc. vasa),
and Septiciana, in Pliny of Clodiana and Furniana. No engraver called
Parthenius is known.

Friedl. translates, ‘sor Parthenius,' and supposes P. to be the well-
known cubicularius of Domitian, whose name, as that of a famous
connoisseur‚ adds value to the plate: cf. l. 47. But it is strange that
Martial should never mention P.'s plate, isso famous.

The Romans set an especially high value on plate or jewellery that
had belonged to illustrious possessors (per multas dominorum elegantium
successiones civitati nota Sen. Dial. ix 1, 7). Some of the pieces of
connoisseurs atthis time had a stemma which tanes oux aarum <a
belief ε so Horace (Sat. i 3, 91l speaks ol plane mammeam& Ὤ
