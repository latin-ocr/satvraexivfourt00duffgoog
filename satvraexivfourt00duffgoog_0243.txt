⁵1· vivam: see n. to 3, 308. Mart. (iv 30) speaks ol the lish
in the Lucrina lake as the property ol Domitian and sacred3 he actually
says that they recognise their master and lick his mighty handl

53. Pallurius Sura and Armillatus, two jurists, are mentioned
as zealous maintainers ol the imperial claims: ol the latter nothing
isknown: Suet. (Dona 13) tells us that the lomrer was once expelled
from the senate and was a distinguished orator.

55. rememsis the property ol' the imperial treasury.’ There
were at this time three treasuries at Rome: (i) the aerarium Saturni,
in the temple of Satum3 it received the taxes and dues levied iu Rome
and Italy and the revenues of the senatorial provinces, and ‹leh-ayed
the expenses os administration in these parts os the empire; (ii) the
marium militaro, which was instituted by Augustus 6 ΑΛ). ἰη order
to provide pensions for his soldiers: its main source ol income was
the vicesima hereditatum, a 5 per cent. succession duty; (iii) the fiscus,
or imperial treasury, probably instituted by Claudius, at least not hy
Augustus, as he never speaks ol it in the Monumentum Ancyranum hut
always ol maa pecunia. The fiscus was managed by an army ol imperial
procuratore and from it were provided all sums required lor the delence
οἱ the empire and for the administration ol the imperial provinces.
The same provinces originally supplied its revenue ; but it gradually

extended its claims (as the present instance may show), until it entirely
superseded the old aerarium or ‘senatorial treasury.'

56. ne pereat, ‘that he may get some good by it,' lit. ‘that
it may not go for nothing’: the same sense would be conveyed by
ut amputare possit. Juv. does not mean that the fish would be spoilt
but that it would be forcibly taken lrom its captor, who would get no
thanks.

lumletifero cet: the language is mock-heroic; lettfero, because
autumnis theseason ol severs and aguess cf. ιο, aar.

57· quartum: this is a sever between the attacks ol which there

58· meantem is predicate.
