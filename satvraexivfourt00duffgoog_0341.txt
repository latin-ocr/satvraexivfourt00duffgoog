79. ‘Lucan may repose in his park, adorned with statues, and
find fame enough’: the poet Lucan (39-65 mn.) belonged to a
wealthy family which took its rise from Corduba in Spain; his father
was Annaeus Mela, and his two uncles were the philosopher Seneca,
and Junius Gallio, so named from adoption, who refused, when
pro-consul in Achaia, to hear the complaint of the Corinthian Jews
against Paul (Acts 18, ro). Lucan had been long dead when this was
writtem he, with all his relatives, lost his life in consequence of Piso’s
conspiracy in 65 aa).

hortis: see n. to 1, 752 they were commonly adorned with statues.

80. Serranus and Saleius'Bassus were both epic poets of some
fame, and both died young, before the publication of Quintilian’s Insti-
tutio (circ. aa). 94); they are mentioned together there x 1, 89 and 90.
Some light is thrown on the circumstances of Bassus by Tacitus, Dr'al.
9 omnis illa laus...ad nullam certam el solidam pervenit frugem... ‚·
laudavimus nuper ul mirone et exineiam Vespasiani liberalitatem, quod
quingenla sestertia Basso dormsset. The date of the Dialogne is 75 aa).

tenui: see n. to tenues 3, 163.

82. ‘The town runs to hear his pleasant voice and that popular
poem, the Thebais’: this poemia twelve books, is the chief work of
P. Papinius Statius (45—96 mn), a Neapolitana see n. ¹to l. 27.
During the twelve years he spent over his poem, he sometimes, as
Virgil had done, gave recitations of parts he had finished; he speaks
himself of giving recitations, but apparently not from the Thebais: see
StatSe'lo. v 3,215 (to his father) qualis eros, Latios quoties ego carmine
patres} mulcerem, felixque lui spectator adesses Ι muueris3 tout. a, 160
he speaks of giving recitations from his Achilleis.

84. aum, sc. recitando. optor affloft=capitetafficil.

86. hegil...versa‚ ‘his lines have brought down the house’ L.:
the damage to the furniture is due to the demonstrations of his hearers,
not to the energy of his own declamation, in spite of ι, ι 3.

87. It is not known from any other source that Statius wrote for
the stage: his Agaue would deal with the same matter as the Bacchae of
Euripides. We have here aclear statement that money was paid for
plays: but that poets were paid by their publisher is by no means
certain. Martial once or, trvice refers a friend, who wishes to get his
poetry for nothing, to the publisher3 but this is not conclusive, and it
is remarkable that he never complains of the publishct’s meamness xo

himself. lt seems probable that poets depended entirely omine morim-
cence of patrous.
