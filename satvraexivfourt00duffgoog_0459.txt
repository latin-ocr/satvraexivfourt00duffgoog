18. rerum...ueu, ‘experience’

proflat is the reading of Ρ, which Biich. keeps: yet the third person,
quite natural in the l. above, is somewhat strained here; and P else·

· where has t where sis required: see ιι. to 3, 2013 Introd. p. xlv. The
Schol apparently read either prussis usu, or prussis usus ; the inferior
MSS. have prussis. ⁴

ιι). It is difficult to say whether magne belongs to praecepta or to
sapientia: ef. Vug. Gearg. ii 490 felix qui patuit rerum cognoscere causas
(ie. the philosopher)... ; fortunatus et ille etc. Perhaps the quotation
is in favour of magna being fem. sing.

ao. sapientie is ‘philosophy,' the ars vivendi, by which Democritus
defied Fortune (ro, 52). Nor must we despise‚ says Juv., the man,
who, though no philosopher of the schools‚ has been taught the lesson
of Stoicism by life, who is an abnormis sapiens like Horace's Ofellus
(Sat. ii a, 3).

αα. lactare iugum, like πρὸς κέντρα λακτίζειν, is properly said of

⁴ oxen ploughing: cs. 6, 208.

23. cesset prodere=nan prodet, ‘that it fails to bring to light': for
the infin, which is common in Plautus, cf. Properti ra, 1 quid mihi
desidiae non cessas fingere crimen? Pliny Epp. vi 20, ιο quid cessatis
evadere? '

25. glasto vel pyxide, ‘by the dagger or the bowl’s pyxzs,
properly a bowl oi box-wood‚ was a name given to bowls of a certain
shepe‚ whatever the matemal, in which drugs (a, 141) or cosmetics
(Mart. ix 37, 4) were kept.

26. quippe, ‘fou' as always in Juv.; in ια, 7 it may be used, as
sometimes by Livy, like ἅτε to introduce a causal participle3 hut after
Cicero the wordisgenerally used as a synonym os nam or enim. Juv. has
it generally as the first, sometimes as the second word, of the sentence.

numere=si numeres: see n. to 7, 175. Thisis Biich.’s reading
indicated by P; other mss. have numera vebs sunt.

α). So Abraham thought there might be ten righteous men in
Sodom (Gerusis c. 18), but there were not. Thebes in Boeotia had
seven gates, each ol which in ,Aeschylus' play is assailed by e separate
champion: the Egyptian city Thebes was ἑκατόμπυλον seen. to 15, 6.
The Nile had seven mouths. Thus Statius, enumerating the gates
of Thebes (Theb. viii 353), illustrates their number by the mouths of
the Nile.

mulne, not became it carries gold like 'lagos or nectendam&
