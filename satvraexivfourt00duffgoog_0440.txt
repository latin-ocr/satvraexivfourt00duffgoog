cease to be entertaining‚ if the host produced a thick roll of his own
composing3 Martial says, as a final inducement to accept a diuna-
invitation, nil recitabo tibi (xi 52, 16). Seneca tells of Cdvisius
Sabinus, a rich freedman of no education‚ that he gave a literary flavour
to his dinners by means of his slaves 3 of these oue knew Homer by

For comparisons between Homer and virgil, cf. 6, 43⁶3 though
unfruitful, they were inevitable and were made even before the
Aeneid was published: so Prop. iii 26, 66 nucia quid maius maner
Iliade. Quintilian adopts the view of Domitius Afer who, in answer to
his question, ‘what poet is next to Homeri’ replied, sccundus cst
Vergilius, propior tomen primo quarn tertia But Quintilian’s own
remarks that follow, show how clearly he felt the differences which

184. quando licebat...t: so Buch. after P; other edd. read licebit
with the other MSS. and explain quaudo as=quaudoquidem as 3, αι.
The difficulty in P's reading is, that we should expect licuit.

185. non faenoris ulla mentio, sc. sit: therefore the negative
should, according to mle, be ne, not non, but there are many exceptions
