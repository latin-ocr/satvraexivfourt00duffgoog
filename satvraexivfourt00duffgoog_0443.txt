NOTES. Α 379

¹ 201. comullbus: L. Aemilius Paullus fell on the field; C. Terentius
Varro survived and was thanked by the senate, quod de republica non
desperasset.

spectent iuvenes: cf. l. 165.

ros. sponsio, ‘betting’: cf. Mart. xi 1, 15 sed cum sponsio fabulae·
qne lassae Ι de Scorpo fuerint et Incitato.

cultae, ‘smart,' ‘well-dressed': cf. 6, 352.

adsedisse puellae: in the theatre and amphitheatro, but not in the
Circus, the sexes were separated: ci. Ovid Tnssst. ii ²83 tollatur circus:
nan tnta labentia circi est; Ι ln'c sedet ignoto iuncta puella viro.

203. ‘But let my wriukled skin drink in the spring sunshine’:
the day of this dinner isApril 10: see n. tol. 193. sitting in the sun
(apricatia) was thought good for the health‚ especially of old men, such
as Juv. now was3 cf. Mart. x rs, 7 totos avida cute combibe soles.

204. etiamtunc togam: cf, 1, 9⁶3 3, ¹7¹3 the toga was the
compulsory dress oi all citizens in the Circus and amphitheatra: cf. Suet.
Aug. 40 negotium aedilibus dedit ne quem posthae paterentur in foro
circooe nisi positis lacrmis togatum consistere. But it was unpopular,
being hot and heavy and also expensive to keep clean; so we find
Martial contrasting tunicata quies with opera togata, and rejoicing in his
Spanish retirement that the toga is there unknown (xii 18, 17).

bulum: dinner was preceded by the bath, as a matter ol course.

the mood, see n. to 7, 14.

206· ad sextam, ‘till noon’: sexta liora may be either a period of
time, lasting an hour, 01 a point of time: here it is the latter. The
date being soon aster the equinox, mid-day will be near rc 0'clock3
in mid-winter it would, according to the Roman reckoning, be much
earlier, in mid-summer, much latere see n. to 10, 016. The cena
usually began at the 9th hour, and the public baths (thereazar) were not
opened until an hour beiore; buton a holiday they may have opened
earlier, or Persicus may have resorted to one oi the many private baths
in Rome.

qmnquc clebus, ‘for awhole week,’ is not to be understood to refer

to the festival of the Megalesia which insted, not imessnut seue-exem·
