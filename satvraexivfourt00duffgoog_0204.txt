Others explain: ‘and to sell slaves by auction’: the trade ol praeca
(el. l. 157) or manga, though despised‚ comes easy to these adventurers.
But praebere (cl. 5, 172) implies personal disgrace, and cannot be used
for vendere. Also, this seems to heve less point, as a climax is required,
and the business of a praeco, though not distinguished, was not in itsell
discreditable.

34. comninos: gladiators are osten represented in works of art as
fighting to the music of horns.

35. comites: the word shows that these men were attached toa

36. munus edere (or dare) and dare gladiatores are the two phrases
used by good writers in this sense; the word munus suggests the
original purpose ol gladiatoria] shows, to do honour to the dead at
funeral games. The same disgust at these shows given by upstarts is'
expressed by Mart. iii 59 sutor cerda dedit tibi, culta Bononia, munau}
fulla dedit Mutinae ,· nunc ubi caupo dabit?

verso pollice: when a gladiator was wounded and at his antagonist's
mercy, the spectators gave the sign lor the death-stroke by this gesture 3
whereas premere pollicem was a sign ol good-will. It is generally
believed that the former gesture wasto turn the thumb up towards the
breast in imitation ol the fatal weapon; and that premere pollicem was
to turn the thumb downwards towards the ground, a suggestion that the
weapon should be thrown down. For this vien, see Wilkins on Hor.
Epp. i 18, 66. Friedl. supposes that the thumb was turned down asa
sentence os death, relying on the evidence os an ancient relies, where the
spectators’ thumbs are turned up and the inscription shows that the
gladiators were spared. When the people wished a brave man to be
spared (missaanem flagitabant), they also waved their handkerchiefs3
cf. Mart. xii 29, ynuper cum Myrina peteretur missia laesa, Ι subduxit
trappas quattuor Hermagmes.

38. cur non omnia? sc. faciant, ‘why should they rehain from
anything?’ Fortune, lor her own amusement, has exalted nobodies;
why then should the nobodies regard any employment as degrading lor

them?
