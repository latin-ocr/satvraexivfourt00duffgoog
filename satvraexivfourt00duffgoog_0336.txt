272 JUVENAL, vn.

²9· venias, ‘may come forword' M. hederis et megine, ‘a bust
wreathed with ivy': thus ovid writes in bauishmcnt to his friends
(Trist. i 7, 1) si quis habes nostris similes in imagine vultus (ie. a bust
ol me), Ι deme meis hederas, Bacchica serta, canois: so it appears that
the ivy was natural, not sculptured. hederae does not refer to any
particular prize, but, as ivy wus¹ sacred to Bacchus, the ivy-wreath
was associated especially with poets, as the laurel-wreath was with
conquerors: ci. Virg. Est. 8, η hanc sine termera arcum Ι inter
victrices hederam tibi serpere risurus.

imagine macra: the bust is lean, because the poet is so too from his
privations. It was the custom to place the busts ol famous poets, either
living or dead, in public and private libraries: so Mart. ix praef.
Stertinium, clarissimum aierem, qui imaginem meam portem in biblio·
theca sua voluit. Asinius Pollio set the example of this good custom,
when he founded the first public library at Rome.

31. laudare: cf. 1, 74 probitas laudatur et alget.

32. The poet, when too old to bea merchant, soldier, or husband-
man, repents too late his choice ol a vocation.

35. Terpelchoren=Musane‚ the special iunction of this Muse not
being considered 3 thus Clio stands sor poetry l. 7.

odit may be transl, ‘cumes’3 cf. 3, ²¹43 6, 27o; Pliny Paneg. 33
nemim impietas...oliecta, quod odisset gladiatorem. ¹

36-97. l'our rich patron, himself a poet, will do nothing sor you
that costs monm. lfyou wish to give recitations ofyoar marks, he
will lend you a disusea' hmese in a distant part os the town and send
his freedmen to applaud; but he will pay none of the necessary
expenses. And yet coe persist in writing poetey! Reol genius con
never be murtzered under such conditions,· to be a great poet, a nean
must be in easy circumstances. Virgils poem oaould not be what it
is, had Virgil been a needy man. The rich enan can be generans to
his mistress ,· he can even affiord such sancies as keeping a tome lion ,·
but flor a poet he has nothing. For a rich poet, lile Lucan, praise
is emough; but staroing paets want padding as well. Statius was
popular: all Rome ran to hear him recite; but he made nathingly
it. An actor is a better patron than the great nobles eff our time.
In the days of Maecenas it mas a different thing.

36. accipe nunc mes, ‘now Ι will tell you the devices’ os patrous.
conferat implies assistance in money, ci. 3, gu.
