INTRODUCTION.

’ v. THE sennim.

The Scholia, or ancient commentaries preserved in the MSS,
are divided, like the mss. themselves into two classes. The
better class are known as the Scholia pithoeana, being con-
tained in P and in none of the interpolated MSS. The inferior
Scholia are traditionally attributed to Cornutus, who is also the
reputed author of a commentary on Persius preserved in mss, of
that writer. Who Cornutus was, and when he lived, is far from
certain. However, in a note on Sat. 9, 37, he refers to llogzhter

Hein'cus; hence Jahn suggested that he was a pupil os Heiric '

who was born in 843 at Auxerre and was distinguished as a
teacher and writer. lt is certain that Annaeus Cornutus, the
friend and executor ol Persius, can have had nothing to do with
these Scholia; but it is possible that the medieval scholar may
have assumed the name, in order to give weight to his annota-
tions on Persius. His commentary on Juvenal must be of great
antiquity, as it is found even in mss. of the 9th century, written
in a contemporary hand. Occasional traces of ancient learning
are found in this collection: thus the allusion to Catullus iu
Sat. 6, 7-not a very recondite allusion-is correctly explained:
but the great mass of the annotations are merely dull aud
superfluous, and some are remarkable for an extraordinary
depth of ignorance and folly. To substantiate this charge,
two explanations are copied here from a Cambridge MS. of
the roth century. They are chosen for their absurdity ; but
though less dull, they are not really less instructive than most
ot' the others. On Sat. 1, 3 the Scholium runs: ‘togatas' vero
feminino genere vucavz't propter luxrm'am illius temporis, ut
Virgilius ‘o vere Phrygiae neque Phryges? iel est, non viri sed
feminae. This shows some knowledge, however applied: the
next is due to mere native brilliance. On Sat. 1, 75 criminibus
