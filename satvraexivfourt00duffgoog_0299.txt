Ι nores. 235

aya. odit. ‘abuses’3 see ιι. to 7, 35. paones is abl. os cause,
‘because ot* an imaginary rival!

273-5. A new sentence should begin here in English ; the ablatives
are absolute: ‘she has tears always in abundance and always ready in
their place and only waiting to see in what way she may bid them flow.’
statto suggests a picket of soldiers. manare is governed by lubeat, not
by expectantibus. For iubeat, cf. Mart. i 3 3 amissum nonflet, cum sola
est, Gellio patrem: 1 si quis (tuest, iussae prosiliunt lacrimae. With
amorem, sc. esse.

276. unt...pnosr, ‘are conceited,’ ‘think well os yoursell'3 cs. ιο,
4¹3 Ovid Renrrd. 685 desinimus tarda quio nos speramus ornari ; Ι dum
sibi quisque placet, creola turba sumus. mucor a word os uncertain
meaning, ol which various explanations are offered by the Scholiast:
(ι) the name given to the stupidus (see n. to 8, 19²) in a larce, (a) a
kind oi animal like a hedgehog, (3) an animal like a weevil that grows
on beans. Ήιε word occurs in Pliny Nat. Hisr. xi rra where it means
‘a caterpillarll

Bttch. explains ‘you worm,’ suggesting that as curculio is the name
ol a parasite in Plautus, so uruca is applied to a creeping‚ crawling,
cringing man.

277. exsorbere, ‘kiss away! lecturo: the voc. is used by attraction
sor the nom.; cf. Virg. Aen. ii 282 quibus, Hector, ab oris Ι expectate
venis? lecture contains the apodosis of a conditional sentence, quae
smpta legas, si retegantur scrinia? See n. to urrisurus 5, 3²· This use ol
the fut. partic, unknown to Cicero, is common in all silves-age writers,
especially in Seneca and Pliny, and is osten introduced as here by
the interrog. pronounr eg. Nat, Hist. vii 105 (of a distinguished
soldier) quae onznia ax oratione eius apparent habita crura in praetura
som's arceretur a collegis ut debilis, quos hic coronarum aceruos con·
strustums hoste mutato: ie. the other praetors tried to prevent his
sacrificing because he had lost an arm; but what heaps ot decorations
he would have amassed, is his campaigns had not been against Hannibal,
when they were seldom won. ·

The scripta and tabellae are the wife’s compromisiug letters.

278. tint, ‘by you.’ zelotypae: cf. 5, 453 the word is post-Augustan
though Cicero uses ζηλοτυπία. There is no Latin word which exactly
expresses the ‘jealousy’ of lovers3 though doloris used lor the resent-
ment ot an injured wife or husband: see n. to ro, gig.

²80· autumnum seen. to 7, ruo.
