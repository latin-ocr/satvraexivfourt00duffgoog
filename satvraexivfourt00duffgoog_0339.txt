53. punitos vena, ‘hackneyed Muse': the metaphor is probably
troni water in the carth, not from metals in a mine: cs. Ovid ex Pont.
ii 5, or ingenioque meo oeno quod paupere manat, Ι plaudis3 ibid. iv a,
oo et comen verto paoperebre fluit.

⁵4· expositum, ‘trite’3 the word is used in the sense oi in medio
positum, δεδημευμένον. deducere is a metaphor from wearing: cf. Hor.
Epp. ii 1, ²²5 torui deducta poemata filo. The word seems not to be
used, like producere (ci. 15, 166) orprocralere‚ oi forging metal.

55. Another metaphor, from coining. For feriat, cl. the title ol
the Commissioners for the Coinage‚ 111 oiri A.A.A.F.F. i.e. auro,
argento, aeristando feriando: we say, ‘to strike,’ in the same sense.

communi moneta, ‘at the mint ol commonplace ἐ ‘mint’ is derived
from moneto, the temple oi Juno Moneta having been the Mint at
Rome. For triviale, cf. Quint i 4, 27 litterarii paene ista sunt ludi
(an elementary school) et trebiatis scientiae.

56. I can point to no such poet now, says Juv.‚ as there is none;
but I leel there might be in ahappier age.

57. Lewis quotes Ovid’s excuses for the falling off in his poetry
alter his banishment to Tomi, Trist. i 1, 39 carmina proveniunt animo
deducto sereno; ibid. 41 carticino secessum scribentis et otio quaerunt;
ibid. 43 carminibus metus omnis obest.

58. impatiens seems to be used with the meaning of expers. For
this idea of a poet's lise, cf. Tac. Dial. 9 poetis...desereeido efficio utque
ipsi dicunt, in nemora et lucos, idest, in solitudinem secedendum est;
ibid. 13 me vero dulces, ut Vergiliusait, Musae, remotum osolla'eitudinibus
et curis...in illo sacro illosque adfantes feram.

60. thynum...oonnngera: the thyrsus is the ivy·bound staff of
Dionysus, which by its touch produced the frenzy of bis worshippers3
hence it is used for inspiration generally3 cf. Lucr. i 922 ocri Ι percussit
thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor; Ovid T cist. iv 1, 43 sie ubi moto
calent viridi meo pectora thyrso, Ι altior bumana spiritus ille molo est.

62. Horace has had a good meai when he writes a fine lyric; the
allusionis to Hor. earm. ii 19, 5 euhoe! receuti mens trepidat metu, Ι
plenoque Bacchi pectore turbidum licitatur. εὐοῖ is the cry of the Bac·
chanals; whence Dionysus is called Eubius and Euhan.

64. dominis...ferun‘tur‚ ‘are borne along by the lords of Cirrha
and Nysa': Apollo is the lord of Cirrha, the port of Delpl1i3 Nysa was
a favoured haunt of Dionysus3 cs. Mart. iv 44, ahora iugo quom Nyssa

colles plus Bacchus amavit: its position was disputed.
