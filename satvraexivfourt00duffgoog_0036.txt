dealt with many different subjects and were written in many
different metres. The fragments still extant would not give a
high idea of· his genius: but we know that his countrymen
thought him the chief m'aster in this style, and that even in
Quintilian’s time he was considered by some to be not only
the greatest satirist but the greatest poet who had used the
Latin languagel.

The next writer of saturae, whom we must mention, is
Marcus Terentius Varro (116—28 B.c.)‚ the learned antiquary
and friend of Cicero. He wrote 15obooks of saturae Memppeae,
so called because they were an imitation of the works os
Menippus, a cynic philosopher of uncertain date, who re·
appears in the pages of Lucian. Here again we see the
influence of Greek literature. Of Varro’s saturae only scanty
·fragments survive: but these are sufficient to show that our
loss is great. An interesting and appreciative account of them
is given by Mommseni'who finds so little to praise in Latin
literature. They were, as Quintilian says³, saturae os the
genuine old kind, a medley of both prose and verse, giving
a series of pictures os contemporary life at Rome, whether
ol social, moral, literary, or philosophical interest. We can
see also that there was a decided personal note in them, an
element of autobiography.

’ The last statement is eminently true also of the satires of
Horace (65-8 Bc). But here there is no prose and no variety
of metres; there is also a considerable modification of tone.
Political invective was impossible sor a man in Horace's
position: it remained for him to attack with reprom, or more
asten with ridicule, the social mistakes or'ethical shortcomings
rs his contemporaries. But invective is by no means the staple
·s these satires. Apparently Horace thought that Lucilius had
rone too far in this direction. The form is often dramatic‚ thus
ἓ. following the tradition ol the ancient satura: indeed in the
second and maturet book there is nothing which is not either a
sjcene or a conversation.
