of various readings and glosses; and that the two different
recensions arose from the fact that the copyists sometimes
adopted the text, sometimes the variants of the original. But
this does not account for the essential superiority of P. How
did it come about that the copyist of P stuck to the text in so
many cases where the other copyists departed from it? The
great antiquity of the inferior recension is proved by the fact
that it is followed, at least as often as P, in quotations from
Juvenal, occurring in Fathers and grammarians of the fourth
and fifth century. Also the Bobio palimpsest, already spoken
of, though it preserves one true reading, lunen, clearly belongs
to the interpolated class of MSS. ; yet the character in which it
is written shows that it must be some centuries earlier than P.

The readings of P are now certainly known, as Biicheler
collated it himself throughout for his edition of 1893. Unless
another complete MS. of the same class tums up, it is not likely
that the text will be materially improved, for conjectural
emendation has done little for this author. But the text of
Juvenal is probably in a fair state of preservation3 though,
when we think how many generations of scholars saw no
difficulty in multo sufflamine consul (8, 148), no wise critic will
deny that there may be many similar passages which contain
corruptions no less serious and as little suspected.

The apparatus given in this edition is a selection of readings,
which have been chosen on purpose to let the reader know
where the text is doubtful, and also to illustrate the superiority
of P, based partly upon the readings peculiar to it, partly on the
nature of its mistakes. Yet, as interpolations do occur in P,
instances of these are given too. Emendations printed in the
J text are referred to their authors; and passages where the true
reading is preserved by the Scholiast are indicated. The
more important readings of the Trinity College MS, mentioned
above, are also recorded. lt is hoped that the selected readings
will be sufficient to atiord an object lesson in the main matter,
the difference between blunders and interpolations.
