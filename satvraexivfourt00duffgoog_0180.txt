116 juvenen, 1.

numquamne: the word, which precedes the enclitic ni in a direct
question, is always emphatic aud generally begins the sentence.

reponam, ‘retaliate'; the word is properly used os ‘repaying' a
debtr cf. Scn. Epp. 81, 9 non dicimus ‘reposuit beneficium',· nudum
enim nobt's placuit quael aeri alt‘eno convenit verbum. It is commonly
used transitively, with several meanings, ‘to place as before,' ‘to place ι
in exchange' etc. Here there is no expressed object, and it seems to
combine the meanings os respondebo and ulciscar 3 in French reperieris
thus used.

For the whole line, cf. Hor. Epp. i 19, 39 nobilium scriptorum
auditor et ultor, where also by revenge is meant reply. For the terror
inspired hythe recitatores, see n. to 3, 9.

a. totiens: the T heseid os Cordus (ci. the Aeneidos Virgil and the
Achilleidos Statius) is an epie, so long that one recitation does not see
the end ol it. Cordus is an unknown poet. For the spelling of his name,
see Introd. p. xliii.

3. ergo is probably derived from e rego, , ‘in accordance with the
direction’; it has certainly no connexion with e'pyp: the word is
scanned as a trochee first by Ovid. The early writers os dactylic
verse have final o short only in iambic words, as citt, modi, hom& the
Augustan writers have it short in cretics also, as potii, Polion the silvcr
age poets shorten any final o except inflexions os the and declension;
and Juv. ventures even on vigilandi 3, 232, where see n.

recitaverit, ‘shall it go ior nothing that one has...’; a normal use ol
the future-perfect, expressing the result, still in the future, os an action,
already in the past: cl. consumpserit below, and Vng. Aen. ix 781 tantas
strages impune per urbem Ι ediderit?

aegeam, sc fabulm. These were comedies ol Roman lite, in which
the actors wore the Roman dress; Afranius (born about r 50 uc.) was
the most successful writer of these plays (Quint. x 1, roo). All the
Latin plays we possess are palliatae, representing Greek lite and

1 manners and played by actors wearing Greek dress, the ἱμάτιον 01
pallium. The sole exception is the Octavia, formerly attributed to
Seneca; this is a praeteria, ie a tragedy representing Roman lis .

5. Telephus and Orestes are the names of tragedies: Euripides
wrote plays on both subjects, of which the former is not extant.

summ1,etc.= ‘an Orestes which, when the margin at the end os the

roll r's already crammed, is written also on the back and even then
reninislred) Tne liber is ihc ordinary papyrus roll, when nnswr'ner
