372 myrnae, xr.

clay3 Etruria was the home os the art, and Tarquinius Priscus had the

first image of Jupiter made at Veii for the Capitol. For the sentiment,
ci. Sen. Epp. 31, ιι cogita illes (ie. deos) cum propitii essent, fictiles
finisse.

uolatus: ct. 3, ao. ί

1¹7· domi netas, ‘home-grown’r the phrase is often applied to
things one need not buy: cs. Petron. 38 nec est quod putes illum quicquam
emere; emnia demi nascuntur. The tables were of common walnnt or
beech‚ notos the foreign citrus.

118. hos: P has hec which Biich. keeps3 and this may be right,
il ad usus can mean, like in mum, ‘lor use'as opposed to ‘ornament’r
cl. Sen Dial. ix 1, 7 nense nen venerate naucularum cmpr‘cua...sedin
ronne posita. Yet the plur. is generally used with an adj„ such as
multos, van'es, hos etc.; and hoc seems superfluous. The proximity of
lignum would account for the corruption of Iros.

ran. numento, ‘scents': these and the roses (cf. 15, 50) belong
especially to the comissatio which followed the cenae see n. to 4, 108.
For orbos, see n. to mensas r, 75.

η 3. ebur er...paruus :eburneus pardus: a hendiadys.

sublimis, ‘rampant'

124. dentibus, ‘tusks': for this kind of table-rest, cf. Stat. Silv. iv
o, 38 (of the tables in Domitian's palace) Indis innisa columna 1 robora
Maurorum (ie. orbes citrei upon ivory supports).

porta Syenes: Syene (Assouan) on the Nile is so called, as being
an outpost on the Rornan frontier: cf. Stat. Sila. iv 4, 63 portae Ι limina
Caspiacae3 Tac. Ann. ii 61 Elephantinen ec Syenen, claustra olim
Romani imperii. Until Trajan's time, Syene was the most distant part
ot' the empire: cl. Mart. i 86, 6 tam lenge est mihiquem Terentianus, Ι
qui nunc Niliacam regit Syenen.

12 5. In addition to Mauretania and Aethiopia, the two breeding-
grounds οἱ elephants in Africa already mentioned ιο, 150, Indicis
here spoken of as a third source of the supply.

obscurior: yet Lucan iv 678 says concolor Indo Ι Maurus. In
point of fact the Moors must have been darker: cf. 5, 53.

126. Nabataeo...sa1tu: the Nabataei lived in part of Arabia
Petraea, and there are no elephants in Arabia: the geography is thus a
little inaccurate.

belua: cf. ro, 158. The elephant does not really shed its tusks
either by sticking thern in the ground iso the schoht or in any other

way.
