THE VANlTY OF HUMAN WISHES, AND THE FOLLY OF
HUMAN PRAYERS.

‘The common-place about the vanity of human wishes...has found a
place, in various shapes, in the works of many of the greatest of all
writers from the days of Solomou to our own... Juvenal, perhaps, has
preached this doctrine as vigorously as anyone else—the more so, no
doubt, because the whole constitution of his mind exemplified that one-
sided vehemeuce and absence of subtlety which belonged to so many
latin writers... When the illustratione appended to such atext are well
chosen and dramatically worked out, as in Juvenal’s poem, the general
drift of the sermon derives a degree of weight from its separate parts t0 ’
which it is not fairly entitled. The true answer to such alesson is, that
people are in reality less ambitious and more successful than it assumes
them to be.' Stephen’s Essays (1862) p. 184.

This is the best known of Juvenal's sentires partly from Johnson's
famous imitation of it. After long passing for a masterpiece‚ it has been
roughly handled by some critics: see Friedl.’s introduction. It is true
that it is easy to pick holes in the argument: for instance, it was not the
object of Hannibal’s life to avoid being defeated and die in his bed; but
the power and beauty of much of the declamation are superior to all

criticism.
