260. It was common to deposit money in a temple for sale-keeping ;
hence arises a question which often turns up in Quintilian, whether theft
ol such money was sacrilege. It appears from this passage, that burglars
had entered the temple os Mars Ultor and carried off not only the
money deposited there, but also what parts they could detach ol the
god‘s own statue: cf. 13, 150-r 53.

vistlam cutura: the. temple of Castor in the Forum, ol which
three columns are still standing, is meant. Castor is called watchful,
because a military guard was posted there (so Μ.).

laage Megalesia (ie. in the interval between Nov. 17 and April 4),
tristes lpersuram thyrsumque tenent et subligar Arei.

264. humum negotia is the subject: the verb sunt must be
supplied: cl. Hor. Epp. ii 1, 197 spectaret papulum ludis attentius
ipsis, Ι ut sibi praebentem nimia spectacula plura.

265. petauro, ‘from the spring-board ': but there is much doubt as
to the exact nature ol this machine. The word is Greek and meant '
originally ‘a perch sor lowls’; in Latin writers it occurs frequently as
an apparatus for acrobats on which to perform dangerous and delicate
feats ol skill: Martial speaks of graciles aias petauri (ii 86, 7). In some
passages it seems to mean ‘a wheel.'
