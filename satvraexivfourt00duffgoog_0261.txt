pervades the whole satirer cf. l. 173. 1t Juv. wrote amico here, r'llt' in

4²· 1111, ‘belonging to him’ i.e. Virro. He must not be blamed;
the jasper on the cup so carefully watched is a famous jewel. The
reading illic, ‘on the cup‚’ has little authority.

43. For the custom of transferring jewels from rings to cups, cf.
Mart. xiv 109 calices getnmatr'. gemmatum Scythicis ut luceat agnelus
(ie. emeralds) aarum, Ι asprce. quot digitos exuit iste calix!

45. ‘The youth preferred to larbas’ is Aeneas, whom Dido pre·
ferred to her African suitors3 ef. Virg. Aen. iv 36 despectus Iarbas. For
the ronndabout way of mentioning Aeneas, which is characteristic of
Juv.‚ see n. to 3, 25. Virgil speaks of jasper on Aeneas’ scabbard, Aen.
iv 261 illi stellatus mspfflefulva Ι erasis crat.

46. These cups were called calices Vatinii, but the metre makes
a periphrasis necessary3 Martial (xiv 96) describes thern as vilia sutoris
‚antanumcnta Vatini. Vatinius, who is to be distinguished from
Caesar's instrument of the same name, had originally been a shoemaker
at Beneventum and became powerful at Nero's court. Martial shows
that the cups were named after him because their shape recalled his
longnose: they had four spouts or nozzles and were evidently not
valuable.

48. rupto...vnro‚ ‘demanding sulphur with its glass broken':
there are two possible explanationsr (1) the cup is said to be asking
for sulphur because it was customary to barter broken glass for stieks
tipped with sulphur, which served as matches: cf. Mart. i 41, 4 qui
pallentia sulfurata fractis Ι permutat vitreis3 Stat. Sita. i 6, 73 quique
camminatis Ι permutant vitreis gregale salsur3 (a) sulphur was used as
cernent: so the Schol. If the second explanation be adopted, vt'tra is
probably dat.

50. decocta was water treated according to an invention of Nero:
it was first boiled (hence the name) to purify it and then cooled with
snow. Martia] (xiv 116) speaks of decoctae nobile fragat aquae.
