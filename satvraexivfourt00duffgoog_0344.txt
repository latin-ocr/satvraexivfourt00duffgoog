280 JUVENAL, vit.

98-104. Historr'ans arc r'n no letter case than ¹loeta Their laborer
aad researclr is more exacting; the material ol their nrany

rolls is more expensive. Bul their remuneratam is quite in·
adequate.

98. historiarum: history was considered by the ancients to bave
more affinity to poetry thau we should allow3 here they together
represent literature: cl. Quint. x r, 31 (oi history) cst proxima poetis
ct quodammodo carrum solatum, ct scribitur ad narrandum non ad '
probandum.

99. ι perit: so P ior petit, the reading of the other uss: though
petit makes sense, pm't is certainly right: it gives the passive oi the
common phrase perdere olam: ci. Cic. ad Att. ii 17. 1 haec non defle·
limus, nr el opera cl oleum philologiae nostrae perierim Mart. ii 1, gat
nunc succinti quae sint bona disce libelli‚· Ι loc primum cst brevior quod
milriclrat‘ta perit. h10=in hoc.

100. ‘For there is no end to it, and every one of you goes on to
his thousandth column, and, as the roll swetls, the account runs up ior
the quantity oi paper.’ millensima pagina: rolls were not manufactured
oi more than a certain size, noo paginae (σελίδες) being the extreme ⁵
limit of a prose-boolt; in this case the roooth column would be about
the end of the fitth roll (volumen or liber). Livy's history (Livius

, argens Mart. xiv 190) consisted os 142rolls.

surgit, where we should say ‘is turned ove1·,' is accounted ior by the
shape of the roll.

101. crescit, ‘lengthens oot’; cs. Mart. v6, 15 m'gra'r pagina crevit
umbilicis. Papyrus was not costly, except in very large quautities:
biart. i 66, 3 spealts oi tomus vilis. .

102. lugens rerum numerus..., ‘the huge extent of the subject and
the rules oi the composition)

¹03· inde=alaborc.

104. For the acta, see n. to 6, 483: a slave would be employed to
read the official Gazette aloud; so at Trimalchio's table (Petron. 53)
actuarius...lanquam urbis acta recitavit: this parody oi the Gazette
begins with the date and includes the births ol slaves, accounts, the
crucifixion ot' a slave, a fite, etc.

The slave would oi course not be paid for reading thisr but Juv.
means that rich men bave poor taste in literature and would, to use a
modern comparison, prefer ‘a copy oi the Times to all the works oi

Thucydides!
