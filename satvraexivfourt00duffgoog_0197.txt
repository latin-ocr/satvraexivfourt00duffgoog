Solonius Tigellinus was a man of insamous character, who encouraged
Nero in all his excesses ; he was forced to commit suicide by Otho
ab. 69: on Juv.’s choice ol an example here, see Introd. p. xxxiv. The
speaker means that it is unsale to satirise the vices of the great.
taem...na10na: ‘you will give light in that coat ol pitch, dressed
in which men stand with breast last to the stake and send out tire and
smoke ς aud your body traces out a broad furrow in midst ol the ,sand’r
i.e. you will be bumt alive in the tunica molesta (see n. to 8, 235), and
your remains will then be dragged by the uncus through the amphi-
theatre. The main difficulty of this interpretation is the change of
tense, with no apparent reason, from lucebis to deducis. Also, if a man
. were bnmt to death, there would be no remeius to be dragged by the
uncus, much less to trace a ‘broad fumow’

Some editors keep deducit (read by P, as also lucebit in 155, which
seems a certain error) and supply quae, out oi qua, as nom. to the verb:
in this oase it is not the body of a single victim, dragged through the
arena, that forms the sulcus, but, anumber of men being bumt in one
long row, their flaming bodies are said to mark out a furrow, or series
os depressions, in the sand. But sulcus surely means a depression ol the
soil, first the mark os a plough-share, and then a ditch or trench;
whereas, at such a scene as Juv. has in his mind, the row os victims
would surely strike the eye as something raised above the soil, not snnk
beneath it. '

None os the many emendations ol this difficult passage has any
probability: dant lucis sor deducis, which is osten attributed to Dobree,
is only quoted by him as the suggestion oi adolescens quidum.

I believe that l. 156 as it stands admits of a quite different interpre-
tation, which accounts sor the chiel difficulty, the change os tense in
deducu. The metaphor of ‘ploughing the sand' is exceedingly common
in Latin in the sense of taking trouble with no result. cf. 7, 48 uos
