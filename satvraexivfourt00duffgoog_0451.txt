NOTES. 387

profundo eiam salo mole oblecta ,·...congestisque pilis neperposuit altissimam
turrem in exeiimlurn Alexandrini Phari, ut ad nocturnos agnes cursum
navigia dirigerent. ,

moles: in Suet.’s description, nieles denotes the breakwater or
artificial island on which the lighthonse stood, outside the two great
piers: but here rnoles is used for all the artifieial structures which formed
the harbonr: the verb (intrat) shows this.

76. Tyrrhenamque pharon, ‘and the Pharos oi the Tyrrhene sea': v
the light-house island oi Alexandria (see n. to 6, 83) gave its name to
similar structures elsewhere; cf. Stat. Silv. iii 5, 99 (oia light-house off
Campania) Bacchei vineta madentia Gauri l Teleboumque amos (Capri),
trepidis abi dulcia nautis Ι lumina noctivagae tollit pbarus aeniula
lunae. A light-house is phare in French‚ and Browning uses the same
word in English.

bracchia are the two great piers which run out to sea and finally
bend inwards again: ior mersum, ci. ιο, 150. They were built with
returns, as we say. ,

78. hon nie, ie. iar less, the portus Augusti being entirely
artificial (manufactus).

79. sed, ‘to retum,’ the digression about harbours being at an end.
tranen ie. dismasted. mansur, ‘the skipper‘: ci. 4, 45.

80. interiora: Traianus portum Augusti restauravit in melius, ct
interius tutiorem, nominis sui, fecit Schol. on 1. 76. Trajan added an
inner basin to Claudius’ harbon, which, being smooth as spond, is
here called stagna: a plan oi the whole is given by Rich sv.
portus.

Baianae...eumbae: even the light pleasure-boats of Baiae might sail
about there; they generally plied in the land-locked·waters oi the
Lucrine3 cf. Mart. iii vo, 19 an aestuantes ciem profectus ad Baias Ι
piger Lucrino nauculamr in stagno? ⁴

81. vertice raso, in performance oi a vow which was often made
by those in peril at seat ci. Petron. ¹03 (where some passengers are
shaving their heads as a disguise) unussorte ex vectoribus, qui acclinatus
lateri aava exonerabat stomachum nausea gravem, notavit sibi adlimam
tonsorem intempestivo inbaermtem ministerio, execratusque anien, quod
imitaretur naufragomm ultimum votum, in cubile reiectus est.

82. garrula as an epithet oi pen'cula is very bold: in sense it is
either an epithet oi nautae (ci. parcam ιο, 116) oran adveth with
narrare (cf. murana 6, 5), ‘spin long yasns ni dangens escanz& w
would not asegarruli: see n. -to Pontica b, bbx.
