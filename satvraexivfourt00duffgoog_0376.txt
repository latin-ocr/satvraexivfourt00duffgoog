312 Juvaunu, vu1.

stickler sor respectability, so that it would be only decent in L. to pass
without recognising him.

virge...aunuet, ‘salute him with his whip’s the phrase occurs
in a different sense 3, 3¹⁷·

ι 54. hordea: this plural, used by Virgil (Georg. i nro), was re·
garded as doubtful Latin, and satirised by Bavius and Maevius, whom
Virgil had ridiculed, in the following verse preserved by Servius, hordea
qui dreit superest ut tritico dicat. Yet the poets continued to speak of
‘barleys‚' undeterred by Bavius and Maevius.

155. littorea, ‘till then‚’ when all restrictions will be removed by
his ceasing to hold office.

unates robumque iuvencum: the epitheta are obviously archaic
and sacrificial, like κορτοίπους the ‘Delphic ⁹ word lor ‘ox’ (Pind. Ol.
13, 81) and φερέοικος ‘a snail‚’ and ἀνόστεος ‘a cuttle·fish' in Hesiod.
All MSS. read uratum sor the unfamiliar rabum, except P which has the
word erased; but the Scholiast preserves rabum and explains it as rebust-
um or rufum3 the latter seems the true meaning. Α similar epithet‚
rebius, applied to victims, is quoted> without explanation by Gellius
(iv 6) from a senatus-cannettum oi 99 nc.

156. more Numae: all ancient religious ceremonies were attributed
to Numa. The ceremony here meant is the feriae Latinae, at which
the consuls celebrated a solemn sacrifice to Jupiter Latiaris on the
Alban mount.

ulteria is not used in the sing. by good writers ; hence it may mean
‘the altar!

157. Eponam: E. dea mutianum est Schol. He insults Jupiter by
swearing before his altar by such an obscure divinity. facies may refer
to representations of Epona, daubed on the stable—walls.

158. Itis difficult to see the force of sed: perhaps it opposes his
private amusements to his solemn public duties; or it may be intensive,
‘still more': see n. to 4, ²7·

neumare: the word means ‘to renew‘ (eg. pugnam 15, 74), and
hence (because the least informality made a repetition necessary) ‘to
celebrate solemnly‚' esp. ol the ferias Latinae: eg. Cic. aa' Q. fr. ii 4, 4
latinae instaurantur. Here it is generally transl. ‘to visit’; but surely
Juv. is using it in exactly the same sense as Cicero above ; and popinas
is added raph προσδοκίαν (as in l. 172) with good ironical effect, where
we should expect Latinas. It may be noted that pervigiles might be
applied to the festiva13 cl. Lucanv 402 uidit flatumisero confectas nocte

latenas.
