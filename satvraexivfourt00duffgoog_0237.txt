SATIRE IV.

n camum councrn.

It has often been observed that this satire consists of two parts,
which have little connexion with each other. The first begins by
introducing Crispinus as the object of attach, and his vices are satirised
(1—33); then follow three lines (34-36) as introduction to the main
episode, in which Crispinus has only a passing mention (1. 108), while

the real subject is Domitianand his manner of behaviour to the high
officials who formed his Privy Council. The poem is certainly ill-
constructed; and Weidner concludes that we have here two satires of
which the first was left unfinished. This may be so; but we have no
reason for supposing that anyone other than the author originally
brought them together to form one poem. See Introd. to Sat. 7.

1—33. Crispinus is once more my theme, that vicians voluptuary. At

' present I deal rather with his follirs than his vices. This Egyptian
upstart paid an enormous pn'ce sor a large mullet,· but rtis was
only in humbla imitation rosiris imperial master.

1. Grlaplnuu: see n. to 1, 26. Juv. speaks as if he had already
attacked Crispinus3 buthe can hardly refer to sat. r, as it was probably
written after sat. 4: see Introd. p. xv.

a. ad partes, ‘to play hispart' on the stage of satire. This promise
is not fulfilled: Crispinus is not mentioned in any of the later satires.

4. deliciae, ‘a voluptuary’; in a slightly different sense in 13, 140.

In Mart. viii 48, 6 nec ηἱεί deliciis convenit iste color (the subject is the
loss of a purple cloak belonging to this same Crispinus), deliciae is
explained by edd. in this sense3 but a comparison with Mart. i 59, o
will show that it means ‘luxury’ in both passages.

vtduar tantum=ras quae viauae (unmarried) tantum sunt: the

ψ notiori is that the seduction of a married woman is a greater crime
and therefore more attractiva to C.

5. quanm...port1e1nus, ‘the size of the colonnades in which...’
porticus is a covered walk in which the rich took their enses, metuerem
from sun or rain,- cf. 7, 178 foll. Therewere three snchwmusmmeses
