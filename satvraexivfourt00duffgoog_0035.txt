INTRODUCTION. xxv

to thern, that in his hands Greek influences added new
features to the originally dramatic satura. Quintilian tells us
that they contained a dialogue between Life and Death; and
Gellius quotes two lines from a satura in which Ennius versified
the sable of the lark and her young¹. The former notice suggests
the influence of Greek popular philosophy or moralising which
is so characteristic a feature of later satire; and the latter
reminds us oi the fable, introduced by Horace into one of his
satires, ol the town and country mousek Thus Ennius, under
the influence of Greek studies, seems to have added two new
ingredients to the farrago oi satire—philosophy and the iable,
which remained more or less permanent features ol the later
forms oi this hranch of literature.

Iu the hands of Lucilius (180 i-ro3 ue), the sutura did not
lose its character as ahrief narrative or picture of life, with an
clement of dialogue, tinged here and there with philosophical
reflexion, and lull os autobiographical detail. But it further
underwent an entirely new influence, that ol the Old Comedy
of Athens. Lucilius was the first writer, who impressed upon
satire that character of invective which ultimately, in the hands
oi Horace, Persius, and Juvenal, became most essential to it.
lt is probahle that the preponderance, which invective assumed
over the other more kindly ingredients os satire in the work oi
Lucilius, was largely due to the character of his age. He wrote
at a time when the corruption and incapacity oi the governing
class were growing every year more flagrant3 and his own
sympathies lay with the more moderate section oi the reforming
party, represented by Scipio and Laelius. Thus, as written hyn
Lucilius, satire becomes mainly the scourge oi incapacity in
high places: ‘Lucilius flogged the· town,’ says Persiust He
is never tired of deploring the decay of old Roman virtue, and
the growth oi luxury, avarice, and selfish ambition. It isin '
this sense that Horace declares Lucilius to depend entirely

on the Old eomedy⁴. We know, however, that his satire}
