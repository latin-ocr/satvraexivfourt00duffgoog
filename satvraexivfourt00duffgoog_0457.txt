suffer. Yet, in spice os your sixty years cy life, you are as angry as
if your misforturn was something serious, and something new.
But every day produces far worse crimes than this. Good men are
sew; the times are had People laugh at you for your simplicity.
T hes is no Golden Age when crime is an exceate'on; on the contrary,
in our days, it is the honest man who is a lusus naturae.

1. exemplo...ma10‚ ⁴ setting a bad example' ; abl. of accompanying

circumstances: cl. Mart. i 27, 5 non sobria uerba subnotasti 1 exemplo
nimium periculoso: so fato 1. ¹04·

committitur: so committunt l. ¹04· Elsewhere Juv. uses admittere
in this sense (eg. l. 237), committere meaning ‘to entrust' (eg. l. 125)
or ‘to join’ Cicero apparently uses admittere ol the moral guilt of an
aetion, committere of the injury to others: cf. ad Fam. iii ιο, a si quid
a me praetermissum erit, commissum facinus et admissum dedecus
conflatam and so Terence Phorm. 415 ut nequid turae ciuis in se
admitteret ; id. Adclth. 682. But later writers seem to use the words
indifferently: cf. Sen. de Chenai 23 videbis ca saepe committi, quae saepe
vindicantur. ...multominus audebant liberi nefas ultimum admittere,
quamdiu sine lege niman fuit. Martial always has admittere scelus,
never committere. ’

r. auctori, ‘the doer’: cf. Mart. ii 72, 5 auctorem criminis huius:
the word means ‘originat0r,' and is applied indifferently to the writer
ol a book, the givet of a present, the plantet ol a trec, the maker of a
cup, the source of a report, the founder of a philosophie school etc. It
is said that auctor is never used absolutely lor scriptam but cf. Sen.
Dial. xi 11, 5.

prima est baec ultio: ef. Sen. Epp. 97, 14 prima illa ct neaxc'ma
peccantium est ponus, peccasse.

quod, ‘that' not ‘because’

3. se iudice, ‘at the bar ol his own conscience’: his conscience is
regarded as outside himself, which accounts lor the abl. absol. referring
to the subject of the sentence.

4. praetoris...uma: this probably refers either to the balloting sor
the names of the iudices before trying a criminal case, or to the um in
which the iudices in the praetor's court deposited their votes.

Servius gives a different explanation in a comment on Virg. Aen. vi
4 31 nec vero sine sorte datae, sine iudice sedes: Ι quaesitor Minos uncam
movet: he quotes this 1. from Juv„ and says ‘u reiciam &amanteum
the Praetor, to determine the order in which cases §mh mm ὣ
