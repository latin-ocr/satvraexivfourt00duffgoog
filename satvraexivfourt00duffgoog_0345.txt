NOTES. 281

105-149. Yon say tbat men of letters are a sels-indulgent set ariel don't
deserve anytloing better. Lawyers are busy ereougle,· do they eleale
large incomesl No; though, in tlte presence of a creditor or a
possible client, tleey pretend tbey do, as a fact one jocbm gets as merch
as a hundred barrislers. T lee lawyer pleads, till be bursts leis lungs,
before a stnpid jury, aoea' gets, as tlte reward os success, some serend-
rate wine or food. If be gets a gmina sor som appearanees, tbe
attorney claims leis share. A rich lawyer can name bis own fee.
So, in order to seem rich, and to keep up appearances, many lavmers
rnin themselves by extravagante. Eloquenee alone will attraet no
clients‚ unless yon wear a fine ring and are attended by a retinueof
slaves and clintls. Eloquence is resented in a poor onam ne bad
better retire to tbe bar of Africa or Gaul.

105. This applies to poets as well as historiatis: cf. Ovid elmi 9, 41

ipse ego segnis eram discinctaque in otia natus: Ι mollierunt animos lectus
et umbra meos. thelectus (or botulus) here mentioned was used by the
student while reading or writing, and is different from the l. tricliniaris
(5, 17) and the l. cubicularis (6, 168), cf. Sen. Epp. 72, 2 qroredam
(some kinds of writing) lectum et otium et secretum desiderant.

umbra, ‘the cloister,’ suggests a lise of retirement: cf. l. 173 and
Hor. Epp. ii a, 77 scriptorum clames omnis amat nemus et fregit urbes!
rite cliens Bacchi somno gaudentes et umbra. So we speak of a man
living ‘in cotton-wool?

106. Juv. here replies to the imaginary objector. clvllla officia,
‘practice at the bar’: a common phrase at this period: see Quint. x
3,11;ibid. 7,1; xi 3, ²23 xii 2,6; Pliny Epp. vi 3a;iv 24‚3alins
exoratum regit, illum civilibus officiis principis aneicitia exeootit. The
last example shows how ‘civil’ became opposed to military tite. Here
the epithet suggests that the barrister is uselul to society iu away the
literary recluse is not.

107. ttbettt, ‘briefs’r cl. Mart. v 51 (oi a lawyer) bic qni libellis
praegravem gerit laetum: the word may stand sor many kinds ol
documents‚ eg. ‘petitions' (14, 193). Quintilian (x 7, 3¹) uses it sor
the notes ol a speech, which a barrister holds in his hand in court.

108. tpet...sonant, ‘they talk big themselves’ ol their gains: the
opposing clause begins at veram l. 112.

red, ‘and‚’ does not contradict, but emphasim, the prasinus state· V
ment: see n. to 4, 27.
