11011111 imtance of it, the crime, not of an indivriiual, but of a

aba.

r. The beginning 01 the satire is a reminiscence of Cic. Tusc. Disp.
v 78 Aegyptiorum marem quis gamat? quorum imbutas mentes prava
moribus marvis (adj.) camificinom pn‘ur subwrint quam ibim aut
aspidem aut faelem aut canem aut mocodilum violent, quonam etiamn
imprudentes quippiam fecerint, poenam nullam recusent.

< 3. pur! hoec, ‘one district.’ Τ111 ibis was worshipped because it

was useful in lrilling the flying serpents from Arabia (Herod. ii 75).

description 01 Palestine 6, 159 and 160.
5. The musical statue 01 Memnon at Thebes was one of the chief

curiosities 01 the ancient world and much visited by travellers. The
statue was 101 long in ruins (dimidioz seen. to 8, 4), the upper part
having been overthrown by an earthquake. Musical sounds, as 01 a
stringed instrument (chordae), came from it every morning at sun-rise.
These are now attributed, not to magio or fraud, but to the vibration
caused in the loosened mass of stone by the rapid change 01 temperature.
When the statue was restored by Severus 11). 101, the phenomena
ceased.
