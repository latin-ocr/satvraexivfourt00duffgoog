noras 397

nominatives from virguncula to Vulcanus 1. 45, have a verb understood,
generally erat or nant.

44. ad cyathos, sc. stabat: Hebe, Hercules’ wife, was cup-bearet
at the celestial banquets, until Ganymede was carried off by the eagle
from Troy, to fill that office. Hephaestus did, according to Homer
(Il. i 597), act as cup-bearet on one occasion to the great amusement
of the gods; but Juv. seems not to refer to this, but to the fact that
he comes, smutty from the forge, to the feast and cleans himself up
during it

etisused fornae: cf. 15, 1²5·

turn uocato nectare, ‘even after α draught of nectar,' whereas the
other gods washed before their meal. siccato means no more than lausto,
though siccare calcium is more correct than siccare vinum: cf. 5, 473
Sen. Dial. iv 33, 5 pocula...siccaral. The Schol. seems 'to have read
saccata, which would give a good meaning: ‘even after the nectar was
strained (ie. ready for the table), Hephaestus was still engaged upon his
toilet.’ ·

45. nparaea...tatremu: see 11. to 1, 7. In Homer (lt. xviii 414)
Hephaestus duly cleanses himself before leaving the forge to receive his
visitor: σπόγγῳ δ’ ἀμφὶ πρόσωπα καὶ ἄμφω χεῖρ’ ἀπομόργνυ] αὐχένα
re στιβαρὸν καὶ στήθεα λαχνήεντα.

46. pandebat, ·‘took his breakfast’ by himself, has the samev
satirical force as in ιο, 178.

47. The increase of gods may refer partly to the deified emperors,
but much more to the foreign deities of Egypt and the East, whose
worship had gradually become established together with that of the
Olympian gods. Before heaven became so over-populated, Atlas had
not such a heavy weight to support.

49. manta, i.e. Neptune or Poseidon

scrutur: the three brothers, Zeus, Poseidon, and Pluto, cast lots
for sovereignty over the upper world, the sea, and the lower world;
hence the sea is called sors secunda as N eptune’s realm, and Hades sors
tertia.

profundi, ‘the deep sea!

50. stmta...eontuge‚ Proserpina, who was carried off from Henna
in Sicily by Plut0.
