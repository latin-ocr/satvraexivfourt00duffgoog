2¹9· mediam, ‘to put in the middle'; some translate, ‘a bust oi
Minerva‚' but it seems doubtful whether Juv. could use rieden in the
sense of dincidia. Minerva, as the goddess of learning, is appropriately
placed over a book-case.
cao. modium suggests that there was so much plate that it was
measured, not weighed. crgmu is not ‘money' but ‘silves plate.'
Yet, as each article of plate had its exact weight stamped upon it,
plate had a kind oi currcncy. A piece os plate of a certain weight,
eg. libra, was a common form of present3 cf. esp. Mart. viii 71.

previous owner, was called domus Asturici (1. ara); or else he isa
second instance of profitable losses.

tuncquam and quasi are constantly used by silverage writers to express
any cpinc'cm or repert, without conveying any notion that the opinion

Juv. seems to refer to the same incident as Martial iii 52²

The circenses, the most popular os all spectacles at Rome, could be seen
nowhere else. The provincial towns had theatres sor plays, and
amphitheatres lor gladiatorial shows ; but they had no Circus. At
Rome this occupied the whole valley between the Palatine and Aven-

seats in wood and marble accommodating‚ at this time, 250,ooo specta·

Titus 80 Ab„ the· Circus was used almost exclusively sor chariot-races.
The number of days devoted to the Circus at this time is not
certainly known: it was about ar under Tiberius, and bs, 'xxx dne
