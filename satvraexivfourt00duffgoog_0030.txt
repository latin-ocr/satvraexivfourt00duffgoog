xx INTRODUCTION.

Does this inscription refer to Juvenal himself or to a member
os his family? We have seen that he mentions (3, 319) his con-
nexion with Aquinum, and the goddess to whom the offering
was made. Also, if the sonos a rich freedman, he was a likely
person to hold the highest municipal magistracies. Again, the ²
mention os the worship of Vespasian points to the reign of the
Flavian dynasty‚ ie. the end of the first century. lt is certainly l
possible that Juvenal served in the army, and reached the rank ἶ
or tribune (which carneo wnn n the privileges or the equestrian J
order) in his younger days before he turned his attention to ,
satire. And this hypothesis has generally been accepted. ι

lt is, however, beset with difficulties. The first, and best, J
sentence of the Biography says nothing of a military career but
rather seems to exclude it by the account there given of y
Juvenal's occupations until middle age. Again, Juvenal, like ³
Persius, does not generally, and especially in the satire devoted
to the subject, speak with favour os a military lis . Again, if ’
Juvenal was rich enough to fill these municipal offices, which
were a considerable burden upon their occupantsl, how can we
account for the complaints os poverty, whether of clients or
literary men, with which the satires abound? Again, the
evidence os the satires goes to prove that Juvenal lived
habitually in Rome, at least after the end of the first century:
is it not surprising that the first satire, which represents the
author as familiar with all the conspicuous figures in the
crowded streets of Rome and with all the scandals attached to
them, should be written bya country gentleman with a dignified
position and a comfortable fortune? The language of the
satires is the language of a poor and disappointed man.
Lastly, it must be noticed that the inscription did not contain

conduct his worship: this was Mark Antony: cl. Cic. Phil. ii 1103
Suet. Jul. 76. The distinction was granted to all the deified Emperors.

¹These magistrates were not only unpaid, but had to pay a
oonsiderable sum, called honorarium, as a contribution to the town
treasury. In the second century, it became difficult to find candidates ,
sor the offices.
