not include in it's text. These therefore may be considered doubtful 3
but of the many others which edd. used to bracket, there is not one,
says Biicheler, which has been proved not to be written by the satirist

93. Tauromenium rs the ancient Naxos on the E. coast of Sicily.
ln the Phalaris controversy, oue of Bentley’s arguments was, that since
the Tauromenites are mentioned in the letters, and their city was not
founded before 396 lac„ the letters cannot be of the age they preiend
to. When his opponents toolr refuge in the desperate suggestion that
the Tauromenites might have got their name from a river Tauromenios,
before there was a city Tauromenium, Bentley replies: “Now if the
Tauromenites were a sort of fish, this argument drawn from the river

L. is a captator or heredipeta (see nn. to 3, ra9; 4, 19); A. is a richarda
whose favour he tries to win by presents of dainty dishes: cf. Mart.
ix 88 cum me captares, nritlebas munera nobis: Ι postquam cepisti, das
mihi, Rufe, nihil. Ι ut captum teneas, capto quoque munera nritte, lde
cavea fugiat ne male pastus aper. But A. is avaricious as well as rich
and, instead of eating‚ sells the good things. Thus vendat is noph
προσδοκίαν for edat or accipiat and th'rows some fresh light on the lady's
character. In Mart vii 20 the last word vendit is παρὰ προσδοκίαν
