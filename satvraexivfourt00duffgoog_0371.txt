nores. 307

Cn. Cornelius Dolabella, governor of Cilicia, was accused in 78 nc.
by M. Scaurus of extortionate conduct, and condemned. Another
Dolabella was impeached for similar conduct in Macedonia by the
young Julius Caesar in 77 lac. Hence some edd. read Dolabellae, with
which the l. might scau by hiatus: see n. to ιο, 281.

Antonius: this is the uncle of Cicero's enemy, a monster of rapacity:
he was prosecuted, also by Caesar, in 76 nc. for plundering Greece and
exiled in 59 ae. for plundering Macedonia, where he was governor
62 uc.

106. venes: see n. to 3, 53: as propraetor of Sicily, nc· 73-70,
he robbed the inhabitants of their wealth and the temples of their
statues (hence sacrilegus), on such an immense scale, that his name
became typical of such crimes3 cf. a, 25 quis caelum terris nan misceat
et mare caelo, Ι sifur displiceat Verri?

naubue altis Ι ecculm, ‘smuggled in the hold ol their ships';
altis here suggests depth, not height. The last syllable of occulta
is lengthened before sp following, a licence almost unknown to the
Augustan poets: Martial, however, lengthens a short vowel before sp
(ii 66, 8), before st (v 69, 3), and before pr (Epig. Lib. 28, ιο).
Horace sometimes has a short vowel before st and sc, but only in the
Satires: cf. Sat. i ro, 72 with Palmer's note.

107. de pace: pace: pacatis gentibus, triumphare de aliqua being
the usual constr. ; in the triumph over a conquered people‚ the spoils
were displayed in the procession; these robbers in time of peace
celebrate more triumphs than successful generals, in the sense that
they bring back more booty; cf. Cic. in Verr. ii 4, 124 honestius est
reipublicae nestrae eaquae illis (ie. Graecis) pulchra esse vrileantur,
imperatorem nastrum (Marcellus) in bello reliquisse quam praetorem
(Verres) in pace abstulisse. Cf. Pelham’s Hestery ofRame, p. 169 ‘the
spoils of peace were richer than those of war, and were more easily
won'

108. nune is opposed to tunel. 100, ‘but now.'

111. malcum, ‘a little shrine' in a private house, not ‘a temple':
M. quotes Petron. 29 grande armarium in angula asili, in cuius
aedicula erant lares argentei positi Venerisque signum marmoreum.
In many Pompeian houses the Lararium is found in the form of a little
shrine in the atrium. ,

111, 112. The awkwardness of expressionis remarhdnle. itm
been proposed to omit both lines: Bucu’s iam for aaut 'rs attractae,

getting rid ofthe repeated ‘fon’
