126 JUVENAL, 1.

87. This is an additional reason ior writing satire. et expresses
⁴indignatione cs. Virg. Aen. i 48 et quisquam numen Iunonis adorat?

88. dnus, fpoeket’ or ‘purse’ 3 lit. the iold of the toga.

89. hos animoa ‘such a aest as now.’ For the omission oi the
verb (here sumpsit as 6, 285), see n. to l. 1.

90. mum, ‘hazard’; lit. throw. Our ‘chance' is derived1from
cadentia. M.

posita may mean (ι) ‘by their side': ci. Mart. ii r, 9 arete, Ι incipiat
positus quam tepuisse calm: or (a) ‘staked on the game’3 cf. Plaut.
Cure. 355 provocat me in aleam ut ega leudam ,· pono pallium. The
first meaning seems the better contrast to comitantibus. Juv. uses

situs thrice elsewhere meaning ‘laid aside’ (a, 743 7, 26 ; 11, 69).
spo 91. proellazfor the imagery, cs. 14, 5, and Mart. xiii r, 5 non ,
mea magnanimo depugnat tessera tela. Thackeray's Barry Lyndon
often compliments his profession of card-sharper with the same

metaphor.

9²· simplexne furor, ‘madness and nothing more’; so ereors
simplex is used sor execution without turture (Suet. Iul. 74). ’

93. et, ‘and yet...'= thisaction is not merely added to the preceding
but contrasted with it. This use of et is peculiar to silver·age Latin:
Cicero uses it only when the first of the two clauses is negatived.

reddere, ‘to give' as due, not ‘to give hack’3 thus reddere oliui
epistulam is to ‘deliver' a letter, not to ‘answer’ it.

· 95. nuno,‘now·a·days.' This is closely connected with what goes
before: the paltry dole is contrasted with the immense dinner consumed
by the rich man himself. But it must be noticed that the mention oi the
sportula tempts Juv. to give a detailed description of the institution,
which is quite irrelevant to the topic in hand; he only returns to his
subject, the selfish gluttony os the rich, at l 135.

spatiumst dole’; lit little basket This dole,’ rn realitya sort ol
daily wages paid by the rich to their dependants, was a regular feature
of Roman lile under the Empire. When clients became too numerous
to be entertained in the ordinary way, a custom arose of distributing
food, which was carried away in baskets (hence the name sportula); but
it was soon sound more convenient to distribute money instead, though
an edict of Domitian was for a short time enforced which required
that a regular meal (recta cena) should be supplied instead of money.

Tlre regular sum was centum quadrantal: αξ) asses or δὲ sesterces) or Ἰ
aboatis. μ’ The name is used of any sum oi money dxstilonted nn· =
