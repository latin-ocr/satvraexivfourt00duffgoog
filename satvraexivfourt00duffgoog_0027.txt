kingdoms opened a new and brighter prospect to men of literary
merit' But Domitian became emperor in 81 A.D.: so the
question arises, whether the evidence is sufficient to establish,
what is in itself highly improbable, that the seventh satire was
written at least twenty years before the first. Nettleship’s
arguments are not successful in provingthis1. There is really
no reason to doubt that the seventh satire was addressed to
Hadrian, and that the third book was published soon after
the new emperor arrived at Rome from the East in August
118a1).

The fourth book contains the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
satires3 but no allusion occurs in them which serves to fix the
date of publication.

The fifth book, containing the rest of the satires, has two
passages, in the thirteenth¹ and fifteenth³ satires, which prove
that the former was written in 127 and the latter at least a year
later.

These dates show that Juvenal was writing satire between
100 and 130 al). Friedlander dates the first book between
112 and 116, thinking it improbable that there was a much
longer interval between the first two than between any other
consecutive books. But a somewhat earlier date seems to be
suggested by the incessant references to the reign of Domitian.
The muzzle was removed in 963 and it seems unlikely that
Juvenal refrained from speech for nearly twenty years. Pliny
and Tacitus lost little time in liberating their souls about
Domitian: the Panegyrims was spoken in 100 nl). ; the
Agn'cola was published in 98. The Biography told us that
Juvenal began writing satire about middle age. A man reaches
middle age soon after forty. Hence we may conclude that

¹ Thus he argues from novorum..,fatorum (7, 189) that Juv. speaks
of Quintilian’s good fortune as quite recent ; but nouomm there means
‘strange' The argument based on Martial’s intimacy with Juvenal is
considered below. For the anachronisms of Sat. 7, see p. xxxiii foll.
