Friedl. thinks Servius must be followed. But the context makes it
clear that what influence secures is au acquittal, not merely an alteration
of the time of the trial.
vicerit, ‘has gained averdict’: see nto vr'ctra'x r, 503 so vaona,
‘an acquittal.’
urna is abl. ol means.
5. This satire, like the last, is addressed to a person otherwise
unknown.
6. crimino, ‘crime’r ct. 1, 75.. sod: the connexion seems to be,
‘it is a wrong, but there are alleviating considerations.’
7. annu cemus: hence tenuis is often used ol men who are poor:
cf. 3, 163. The sum lost is stated l. 71.
8. mergat onus is a mixed metaphor, unless the man is compared
to a ship, which would be very awkward after tecturae: cf. ro, 57.
rara, ‘seldom’: see n. to 8, 63.
9. mnltts cognitus: cf. 12, 26. tam, ‘quite’: seen. to 3, 206.
ro. emedio...acervo‚ ‘drawn from the middle ol Fortune's store,’
i.e. a piece of average fortune, neither very good nor very bad: cl.
Hamlet 11 a ‘Guild- On fortune’s cap we are not the very burton.
Haml. Nor the soles of her shoe? Rorenc. Neither, my lord’
12. dolor, ‘resentment’ For the abl. vulnere, seen. to 4, 66.
¹3· quamvis, ‘however,’ qualities levium only: so 3, 282 and
Mart. v 52, 7 quamvis ingentia dena Ι auctoris pereunt garrulitate sui.
15. decoribus: the ancients generally considered the iecur to be
the seat of anger: cf. 1, 45; 6, 648. spuneare, which suggests the
soaming mouth of a wild boar, is a bold word to use of the vt'sccra.
reddat is subj„ because it is the reason in C.'s mind sor his wrath.
16. depositum: refusing to refund a sum of money entrusted lor
e keeping was a common form ol crime, as is shown by Pliny’s
rous letter about the Christians in Bithynia (nl). nal: they said that
y took an cath, ne furta, ne latrocinia, ne adulteria committerent, ne
'tm fallerent, ne depositum appellati abnegarent (Pliny ad T raj. 96, 7).
17. This l. affords an exact date for this satire, and an approxi-
mate date sor the book oi which it is the first. When a year is denoted
by the name os one consul only, the name is that which has precedence
in the Festi. This condition is satisfied only by Fonteius Capito,
consul in the year 67 ab. Consequently, Calvinus was sixty years

old in 127; and this satire was written in, or immediately aster, that
year. The Schol.’s notion that lav. is snealringol himselt in this l.. is

a mere blunder.
