96. The obvious peculiarities of the Jewish ritual are here
mentioued-their keeping of the sabbath, the absence os images in
their temples, their abstention from swine's flesh, and the practice of
circumcision. Their peculiarities gave them the reputation of misan-
thropists; and other Roman authors, eg. Tacitus and Pliny the Elder,
speak oi them with contempt and dislike. The present passage seems
to show that Jewish proselytes were not uncommon at Rome. Eveu
in Horace’s time, his iriend Fuscus pleads, no doubt in jest, as a reason
ior postponing business, bodie bucsima sabbata (Sat. i 9, 69).

metuentem here and l. 101, has probablya technical meaning: fora
similar term was applied by the Jews themselves to those not of Jewish
birth who were friendly to the Jewish religion: thus Paul addresses
his audience in the synagogue of Antioeh, ἄνδρες Ἰσραηλῖται rai ot
φοβούμενοι τὸν θεόν, ie. Jews and Judaisers (Acts 13, 16).

sabbata: cf. Pers 5, 184 recutitaque sabbata palles.

97. nubea: the shadowy and unsubstantial objectos Jewish worship
is thus contrasted with the anthropomorphism os paganism. Thus
in Aristophanes’ comedy, the sollowers of Socrates, having put aside
other deities, worship the clouds. Tacitus has little good to say os the
Jews, but he is forced to admit the pure nature os their worship: Hist.
v 5 Iudaei mente sola unumque nrcmen intelleguntrprasanas qui deum
imagines mortalibus materiis in species bominum effingam surrectum
illudet arianum neque imitabile neque interiturum.

caeli numen, ‘the holy sky’: cf. 6, 545: the idea that the Jews
worshipped the sky, perhaps arose from their unwillingness to utter the
name of God, which led them to substitute ‘heaven’ as in ‘the kingdom
of heaven!

98. They think pork·eating as bad as cannibalism: cs. 6, 160 and
Tac. l. l. 4 sue abstinent, memoria cladis, quad ipsu scabies quandam
turpaverat, cui iel animal obnoxium.

99. praeputia nonunt, ‘they are circumcised': ct. Tac. l. l. 5
circumcidere genitalia instituerunt, ut diversitate noscantur.

100. Ancient accounts agree in attributing to the Jews a hatred ior
all nations except their own: cs. Tac. l. l. 5 adversus omnes alios hastile
odium. ...trangressi in narrem carum idem usurpant, nec quicquam prius
imbuuntur quam contemnere deas, exuere patriam Quint. iii 7, υ
perniciemne ceteris gentem.

ror. Perhaps the line is meant to parody biblical lauguage‚ such

as abounds in Psalm cxix. ‘lhe intense devotion pi metens to their
