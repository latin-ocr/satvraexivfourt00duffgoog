120-173. Woll, will you accept sooch consolation os I can offer, though
lam no philosopher os the schools? Considor that yours is no
isolatod caso, that impudent fraud is rofi on all stilos: why should
you do more fortunate than your neighbours? Aguin, thoro aro
worse arthous thou thot from which you suffer: some mon are killed
ly voolonco ,· others hove their husos hurnt ; templus art rabbad, and
inunges os tho gods osolted mun ; romombor all tho casos ry‘poisons'ng,
and ospom'cu'de. A single day, spent in thopolt'co·court, will provo
