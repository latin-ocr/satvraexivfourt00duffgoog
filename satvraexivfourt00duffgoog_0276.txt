212 Juvnwau, vr.

as compositionis concemed, is a mere chamber ol horrors. The main
theme, that it is madness to marry because a good wife cannot he found,
is not so much worked out as illustrated by a series of pictures quite un·
connected, and arguments sometimes inconsistent...

The inconsistencies might be defended in a humourist: he would be
in his right in saying that a licentious wife or an over-virtuous wife are
equally objectionable. But this ground is not open to the moralist, who
is bourn to defend virtue against all cavil’ Nettleship, Jaum. os Phil.

1. Saturno rege: the reign of Saturn was the goldeu age of
innocence3 cf. 13, 38 foll.; Virg. Aen. viii 319 prauus ab aetherio veuit
Salumias Olympo. Ι ...aurea quae perhibent illa sub rege ficere Ι saecula.

above ; Cic. de Orat. i 36 inilia genus hominum in montibus ac silvis

The juxtaposition of the adjectives at the beginning of the sentence
shows that they are used instead of an adverbial clause of place: so
Ariciuos=Ariciae (at Aricia) 4, 117. For an adj. taking the place of
an adverbial clause expressing time, see n. to 1, 28. Ἴ

terrae naclunw tempore capti, Ι circum se foliis acfrandibus involventem

bed of leaves) ἄφαρ δ’ εὐνὴν ἐπαμήσατο χερσὶ φίλῃσιν Ι εὐρεῖαν· φύλλων
