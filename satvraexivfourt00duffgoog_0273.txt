qualem cauam edt't, aias. Report said that Claudius was poisoned in a
boletus by his wile Agrippina: cf. 6, 6ao; Suet. Claud. 44.

A Roman dinner at this date was generally divided into three
parts: (ι) gratus or promulsis (so called because neutrum. wine aud
honey‚ was often druulr then); ruis consisted mainly ot vegetables,
egga, and dried fish3 (a) sertula, the actual dinocr, with different
kinds of fish and meatt (3) mamae sanandae, a dessert of fruit. Virro’s
diuner does not follow this order exactly. Juw. begins with the wine
and breed (24-75), goes on with fresh fish, which would naturally
be a sarculum tao-106), then to the fercula (114-145). Now come
the boleti, which would naturally form part ol the gustum and lastly
fruit (149-155) in its proper place as ntensae secundae. l have begua a
new paragraph at ¹49», to show that boleti are not a part ol the dessert.

149-155. The sarm distimtr‘on is observat in tlte desscrt supplied tn
n‘clt and poor.

149· The ‘rest oi the Virros’ are not the host’s relations hut

those guests whom he treats as equals. For reliquls, see n. to ro, 260.

150. pomo, the regular close ol a Roman dinner; hence the

proverb ab ovo Ι usque ad mala (Hor. Sat. i 3, 6). The word is used ol

. other furit, as well as apples: c.g. Ovid Fast. ii 253 stabat adhuc duris
ficus ώηιίιιίιιια pomis.

pascam, ‘one might feast’3 see ιι. to nolis 1. 54. Cf. Mart.
quoted on l. 162.

151. The referenceisto Hom Od. vii 114-rar‚ where the never·
failing orchard ol Alcinous is described. From 1. 117 τάων οὔποτε
καρπὸς ἀπόλλυται οὐδ’ ἀπολείπει Ι χείματος οὐδὲ θέρευς, ἐπετήσιος, it
seems that autumnus means ‘fruit-trees’ or ‘fruit-time ’; cf. Seu. T lyest.
168 (of the fruit-trees eluding Tantalus) tolus e'n arduum Ι aretumuns
rapitur silvaque arabilis.

152. Hercules carried off the golden apples ol the Hesperides
which were guarded by a dragon.

15 3. scabie mall ‘a rotten apple.' quod should strictly be quale.
aggere, ‘the embanlrment'; see n. to 8, 43.

154, 155 are a roundabout description ol a performing monlrey, which
is taught to shoot, riding on a goat. flagelli: cl. metuens veterae 7, 210.

156-173. This treatment is due, atat to Virro’s meanneu, bat to
his pleasure in your pain. A free arua ought unt to submit tu
matemala, merely in the hope of getting good things tn eut3 aad

efyaaput up with it, you destrue att you suffer.
