prefect in the year 89 and was then more than sixty years old.
ln the first satire there is still worse confusion : the mention of
· Marius's condemnation proves the date to henot earlier than
100 A.D.; but, wishing to show by an example the danger of satiris-
ing living criminals, he actually chooses Sofonius Tigellinus, a
notorious figure in Nero’s reign, who was forced to commit
suicide in the year 69. ln view of such eccentricities as these,
which might have been intended to mystify commentators then
unborn, the difficulty of which Nettleship speaks is a real one.
Yet the evidence of the satires, already considered1, makes it ’
“ probable, if not certain, that all the¹ emperors attacked by
Juvenal, Domitian as well as the whole list from Tiberius to
Otho, were dead before the attacks were published; and also
sthat the living persons whom he assailed were for various
reasons powerless to take revenge. But if there was little

danger in this method, there was also little glory. Juvenal
certainly did not borrow it from Lucilius or from Lucilius's
master Aristophanes, who, after Cleon’s death, refuses to

trample any more on his familiar victim.

But it may be argued that, although Juvenal speaks of the
dead as if they were still living, and of events of forty years
before as if they were passing before his eyes, still his de-
scriptions of the corrupt state of Roman society are true in
the main of bis own day. Itis said that Juvenal’s account of
Roman life agrees substantially with that given by Tacitus,

, But here we must remember that the historical works of Tacitus
do not touch the second century, he intended to deal with the
reigns of Nerva and Trajan in his old age2, but we do not
know whether he lived to do so. If we turn for information to
Pliny’s Letters, which were written between 97 and 110 A.D.,
just when the earlier and fiercer satires of Juvenal were appear-
ing, we find ourselves in a different world from that scourged
by the satirist There are still traces of the bad old times3 but
the notorious figures of Domitian's reign, who still survive, the
Reguluses and Veientos, must blusb to find themselves still
