xxx INTRODUCTION.

Juvenal followed, perhaps consciously, the example of Horace,
who, in later life, discarded satire for epistle· The style of
Horace does not, indeed, like that of Juvenal, become more
prolix with increasing years; but the unlikeness between

, Horace's earliest satires and his epistles is as marked as that
between the early and late satires of Juvenal. The latter
preferred to call all his poems by the name of satires. Now the
peculiar excellence of the satura was just this, that it was not
bound, either inform or matter, by rigid rules; yet it was a
decided innovation to apply the name to epistles.

Our next business is to consider how far Juvenal, especially
in his first· three books, conforms to the practice of his pre-
decessors. He does not pose as an innovator on the established
methods. ln the preface to his work, he refers to both Lucilius
and Horace, and professes to be carrying on their tradition 1.
Nevertheless, his treatment of the satura is, in many respects,
pectiliar to himself. Indeed, it is doubtful whether the words
‘satire’ and ‘smirical' would bear exactly their present meaning
if Juvenal had never written. Much in the same way Martial’s

titis has given to the word ‘epigram’ a shade of meaning

leh it did not necessarily convey before his time.

Iu the hands of Juvenal the prose and mixed metres of
'um and Petronius have entirely disappeared. He writes in
lexameter verse, a metre employed largely by Lucilius and
exclusively by Horace. But his management of the metre is
luite different from theirs. Instead of the easy, conversational
verse of Horace, we find the powerful but monotonous measure

of Lucan and the later Roman Epic2. This change is of great
significance: Juvenal rightly felt that the frequent elisions and
irregular pauses, the roughness and occasional oddness oi
Horace's Sermones would be out of place in his own satires.

² Two lines of Tamus, a contemporary of ,Martial's who had a high
reputatiou as a satirist, are quoted by the Scholiast on Juv. 1, 71: ex
quo Caesareas suboles Lucusta cecidit Ι horrida cure sui verna nota
Nerom's. The second verse is corrupt; but the first sounds quite like a
