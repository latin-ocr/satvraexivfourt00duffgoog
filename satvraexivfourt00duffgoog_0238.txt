1111111 is not a needless epithet; it is emphasised by separation
from the noun and is meant to 10100 01 the reader that the Vestal, even
in her dress, was distinguished from other women and set apart 1011
sacred calling. Cf. Stat. Theb. vii 758 conatusque toris vittatam ottin-

A Vestal who had broken her vows was buried in an underground vault
in the Campus Sceleratus, a light and some sood being 1011 with her3
and this punishment, aiter long disuse‚ was inilicted by Domitian as
censor upon Cornelia, 010 01 the Vestals, 91 111. : 01. Pliny Epp. iv 11,

ditional sense 01 the sut. participle is common in silverage Latin:
see n. 10 6, 277. For it is not probable that any other Vestal
actually suffered this punishment during this period, or Pliny would
mention it.
