· to gay, must be now an orator, now a wit, now a poet, and
must reserve his strength1. lt will be seen at once how little
this description suits Juvenal. He is the most diffuse and the
least versatile of writers, and uses the force of a steamhammer
to crack a nut. Again, Horace, as a satirist‚ does not stand on
his dignity: we are allowed, and expected, to laugh at him
when he is lectured hy his slave or butten-holed by the bore on
the Sacred Way. But this attitude of sels-depreciation, and all
the other touches that gave humour, gaiety, and kindliness to
the satura, have disappeared in Juvenal The one thing we
find in those poems which are really satires, is vigorous and
even violent declamation against vices and vicious persona. The
fact is that Juvenal was ahorn rhetorician‚ who had cultivated
his natural gift by the practice of hali a lifetime3 and con-
tinuous rhetoric is entirely opposed to the spirit of the genuine
satura To sum up: while the later satires ol Juvenal are not
really satires at all, he has, in his earlier work, discarded almost
entirely the peculiarities oi metre, treatment, and tone, which
had been characteristic os this kind of literature and may be
seen surviving in the Sermones os Horace. The ‘medley’ is no
‚longer a medley; sor the invective, imported into it almost
accidentally by. Lucilius, has overwhelmed the other ingredients
and leavened the whole lump. ¹
Juvenal probably felt, indeed he hints as much himself, that
he had not by nature such powers as would enable him to rival
is predecessors in their own line. To sketch living types was
te object ol their art; and' this was quite out os his reach.
irom Juvenal we hear what people on particular occasions
tave done3 but we know nothing of their personality, he
cannot draw a character, he cannot laugh. Think of Juvenal’s
Virro and then of Petronius' Trimalchi0; theone is a figure
' cut out in paper‚ the other a living man².’ His motive also, at
= least his ostensible motive, was different: he professes no wish
