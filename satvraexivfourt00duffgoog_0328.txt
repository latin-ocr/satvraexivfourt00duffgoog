615. atterere, ‘to go mad as well': the mere loss of your iaculties

616. ‘Into whose cup Caesonia poured the whole lorehead of a
staggering (ie. new-born) loal’3 sor the sact here alleged, cf. Suet.
Calrg. 50 creditur potionatus a Caesonia neom amatorio partilem medr‘ca·

descendero ln caelum is an oxymoron; the expression is intended
