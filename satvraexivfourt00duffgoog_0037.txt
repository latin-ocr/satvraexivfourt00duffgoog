The next name in the history oi satire is that of Persius

(34-62 Ma). But, though there is a highly peculiar and
personal flavour in his strange genius, he was still in the
imitative stage at the time os his early death, and his form
is entirely derived from his predecessors, especially Horace.

The saturae of Petronius, whose author is believed to be the
Petronius who died in 66 an, are of a very different character.
The work originally consisted of a number of books; the
extant portions are extracts from the fifteenth and sixteenth.
The manner of Varro is to some extent revived, prose alternating
with verse in various metres. But the chief innovation is that
the satura has now assumed the form of a connected narrative,
describing the adventures of a Greek freedman in various
towns oi Italy, related by himself. The lact that only certain
episodes are preserved, makes it impossible to trace exactly
the evolution ol the story. The work of Petronius is highly
dramatic3 and the pictures of lise and character are drawn
by a masters hand. For easy humour and graphio realism,
there is nothing in Latin, nothing even in Greek, literature
, that can compare with the ‘Dinner ol Trimalchio,’ which is
the subject of the longest and most important ,fragment
now extant. lt would hardly be extravagant to compare
the genius of Petronius with that oi Sterne, alike in its ex-
cellentes and also in the stains by which it is disfigured.

We see then that the name satura is applied to com-
positions of very different kinds. There seems to be little
in common between the poems of Lucilius and the rornan'ce
of Petronius. Yet, as Nettleship points out, there are two
characteristics which reappear in each successive writer of
satura, and which are not entirely lost even in Petronius or
Juvenal. First, there is always a marked personal elernent: the ι
writer addresses the general public or an imaginary companion;
hence the frequent occurrence of dialogue. Secondly, the satura .'
never contains a regular plot: it consists of talk, flowing at will
and not bound by 'the laws os more formal literature.

of the specimens still extant, Varro's fragments show most
clearly the mixture of verse and prose: from the same sutura
