noros. 309

125. quod modo proposui refers back to ll. 87-94. sententia,
‘a thing said sor effect’: the word originally represents γνώμη, a

maxim or general statement dealing with human lite or action3 but
in the rhetorical schools the meaning was considerably modified‚ and
Quintilian defines sententiae as lumina...praecipueqree in clausulis posita,
‘striking phrases, especially at the end of a period.’ cf. also Tac. Dial. Ι
aa (os Cicero's style) pauci sensus apte et cum quodam lumine (i-e. sen·
teutria) terminantur. Thus the meaning is alrin to our ‘epigram': ci.
Sen. Epp. roo, esuriei ictus sententiarum. Silver·age literature suffers
from perpetual straining ior sententiae. Juv. has many such; spoliatis
arma supersunt in l. 1²4 is a sententia.

Quintilian deals at length with this important item oi rhetorical
equipment (viii 5) ; he defends them in moderatiori, but considers they
were over-done in his time: ς 34 ego vero lraec lumina arationis velut
oculos quosdam eloquentiae ereda: sednon oculos esse toto corpore velim:
§a (sententiae) minus celebratae apaed antiqrus nostris temporibus niodo
carent.

vormerio: truth is opposed to a sententio, which aims only at
rhetorical effect: cf. Petron. r sententiarum vanissimo strepitu.

126. vobis is addressed to all who, like Ponticus, hope some day to
rule a province.

tonum...sroy11ae, ie. a divine prophecy and therefore a certain
truth: ior the Sibyl, seen. to 3, 3: her oracles, said to be written on
palm-leaves, were preserved in the Capitol, and to consult them was the
special duty oi the college oi quindecemviri.

127. oohors is the technical word for a provincial governor's staff:
ci. Catuli. ro, ro resumat adpulerat, nilril neque epse} Ι nec praetoribus
esse nec cohorti. ’ ’

tribuna1=legal decisions.

128. eooroocomos, intonsus, properly an epithet ot' Apollo, is
here=puer capillatus, a favourite slave, who is allowed to interfere
with the course of justice. oomuga: in the trials ior repetendae men·
tioned by Tacitus and Pliny, the governor's wife isin several cases
put on trial; cs. Tac. Ann. iii 33 cogitarent apsi, quoties repetundarum
aliqui arguerentur, plura uxoribus obiectari, and F urneaux’s note.

129. conventus, ‘districts’: to facilitate the administration of
justice, a province was divided into a number of districts or circuits‚
called conventus: the word is also applied to the nreetrngshehd amnem

centres; the governor was said conventum ugare⁸ ei. Suet. Goth. n,
lua 30.
