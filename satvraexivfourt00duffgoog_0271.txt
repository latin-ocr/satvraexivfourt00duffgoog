134. quanm...emtem, ‘how valued a friend'3 the sense is dif-
ferent from magnus amatus 1, 33, where see n.

135. This is how Virro would spealr then, first to the servants,
theu to Trebius himself. fruteria a complimentary term used between
equals in rank and age; Horace recommends it to electioneerers
(Epp. i 6, 54). With vlu, supply titi detur.

136. ilibus: this was thought the choice bit of ¹the whole boun
cf. Mart. 1145, 3 costam rodere mavis Ι ilia Laurentis cum tibi demus

apti. Buchelers explanation, that ab ajasis ilibus goes with frater
in the sense of αὐτάδελφος, is surely, impossible.

139. luserit: the subj. is used, by the regular mle, for the imperat,
when the prohibition is in the 3rd person; the tense is aorist, not
perfect, aud is exactly like the present (ludat) iu meaning ; cf. Livy
ix 11, 13maratussitnemquominus...abeant; see 11. to 7, 93.

unm=filtim the allusion is to Dido‘s words Aen. iv 328 si
quis mihi parvulus aula Ι luderet Aeneas,...n0n equidem onanino capta
ac deserta viderer. Juv. means ‘you must have no children, you must
be orbus, so that Virro may hope to inherit your money.’

illaquam filius: the use of r'lle without emphasis is characteristic
of silver Latin: see n. to 6, 174. ,

(Μ1 Lendrum, however, explains illo as=quam W'rro: ‘you must
have no son nor daughter to cut Virro out.')

140. iucundum and carum are predicate, not epitheta. ι

141. nuuc, ‘asitis,’ ie. asyou baveno money to leave. Mycale
stands for the wife of Trebius: cf. Mart. xi 55, 5 dicat praegnantem tua
se Cosconio tantum, Ι pallidior fiet ιἀνη pariente Lupus (L. is a captator).

This explanation, which is given by M, I believe to be right; but it
is uot even mentioned by Friedl, who adopts the following view: the
suppositiou that Trebius is rich, holds good to the end of the paragraph3
Mycale is not a wife, but a concubina; hence his children by her have
no legal claim to his money, and Virro may hope to inherit. The
grounds on which this view is put forward seem to be: (1) that the
contrast between Virro's treatment of the father and the children is
unaccountable3 (a) that Mycale is an impossible name for a Roman
wife.

lt seems to me certain that nunc is used, as constantly, to deuy a
supposition, which is, in this case (l. 132) that Trebius is riche such a
nunc need not begin the sentence. On the new view, auoe'mo suh

the least of it, useless. Again, itis drsfmctly stated unat ’ἳκῖζῖς
