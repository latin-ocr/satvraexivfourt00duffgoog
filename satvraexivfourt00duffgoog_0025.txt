INTRODUCTION. XV

date will hold good approximately of the whole book which
includes it.

The first book contains five satires3 and the first satire
(which, serving as a presace‚ was probably the last written)
contains an allusion¹ to the condemnation of Marius Priscus for
misgovernment in Africa. Now we know from Pliny, who was
prosecutor in the case²‚ that the date of this trial was 100 nn.
lt follows that the book was published after this date, though
how rnuch later is, within limits, a matter of conjecture. Thus
Domitian had been dead at least four years before Juvenal’s
first book was published; and, further, the ‘dancer' Paris was
put to death by Domitian in the year 83; so that neither
emperor nor actor was in a position to resent allusions to thern
occurring in a satire of much later date. The second and fourth
satires of this book contain attacks on Domitian³‚ which could
not conceivably have been circulated, even privately‚ besore 96,
the year of Domitian's death; and, in fact, a passage in the
latter⁴ refers plainly to his assassination.

The second book contains only one satire, but that avery
long one, the sixth. In it there are mentioned, as topics of
the day, a comet boding disaster to the Kings of Armenia and
Parthia, and a great earthquake in the East accompanied by
inundations. Now a conspicuous comet was visible at Rome
in November of 115⁶3 and Trajan began his campaign against
Parthia in the following year. (lt is true that the Armenian
campaign was over in 114; but this slight inaccuracy on Juvenal's
part need not disturb us.) Als0‚ there was a famous earthquake
at Antioch in December of 115, in 'which Trajan himself had a

narrow escape from death. lt seems a certain inference‚ the‘
Juvenal’s second book was published not earlier, and not m
later, than 116 nn.
