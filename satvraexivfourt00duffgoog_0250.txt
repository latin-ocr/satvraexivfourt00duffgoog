186 Juvsrvnu, 1v.

116. a ponto satelles: ‘a beggarcourtier’: a ponte=meudicus=
the phrase is similar to meretrix Augusta 6, 118, and mulio sanuel 8,
148: in each the juxta-position 01 the two nouns is a kind oi oxymorcu.
Catullus is asatellcs, ‘atyrant’s minion,’ these satellites (δορυφόροι) being,
like arx (see 11. to l. 145), a regular attribute 01 the tyrant: so Pliny
(Paucg. 13) says 01 Trajan, contrasting him with Domitian, that be
entered Rome, not stipatus satellitum rituum so Pothinus, Pompey's
murderer, is constantly called the satelles 01 King Ptolemy: eg.
Lucan viii 675 Pharius...satelles. Such persons live in kings’ houses
and are as iar removed as possible from beggars on the bridge. But the
blindness and servile manners of Catullus make Juv. call him a beggar,
just as he calls the consul, who holds the reins himself, mulia

For a ponte, 01. 14, 134 aliquis de parete, ‘a beggar’: bridges
were savourite stands (stationes) 01 beggats: 01. 5, 8; Mart. x 5, 3
erret per urbem pontis exul et clivi (ie. driven even from the beggars'
stands).

The epithet dirus, ‘sormidable,’ itseli indicates that satelles means a
poweriul and wicked man, not, as it is generally explained, a beggar 3
applied to the latter it can only mean ‘ill-omened,’ and so M.; but the
first meaning would at once occur to the reader's mind in connexion with
such a notorious delaturas Catullus.

117. Aricinos...axee: Aricia was in a hollow on the Appian Way
about 10 miles from Rome: Aricini may be said 01 carriages coming
to, or leaving, the village: seen. to 6, 5. For Aricia as a resort 01
beggars, cf. Martii 19, 3 debet Aricino recumbere clivo, lquem tua
felicem, Zoile, cena facit.

118. devexae, ‘descending the slope': the beggar is demon·
strative in his gratitude, when the carriage leaves him behind; 01.
Mart. i 3, 7 (01 a recitet thanking an audience 101 their applause) dum
basia iactas.

¹¹9· plunma dixit, i.e. he was loudest 01 all in its praise ε 01. Pliny
Epp. ii 14, 8 (01 an audience at a speech) uam plerique neu audiunt
(listen), nec ulli magis laudant.

110. at may be transl. ‘unfortunately': it seems to have sometimes
an ironical soree which scel, 101 instance, has not: 01. Cic. acl Att. vii 11,
1 consul ei rescripsit, ut prius ipse ire Picenum (sc. iret) ,· at illud tetum
crat amissum3 ibid. viii 8, 1 fulsisse milti vc'debatur ri καλὸν ad oculos
ems.,..· at ille tibi πολλὰ χαίρειν τῷ καλῷ diceus pergit Brundisium.

111. sle, i.e. with equal knowledge 01 the laets.
pugnas is perhaps ‘ieints'3 01. the Coruin puguoe aliquid dor
