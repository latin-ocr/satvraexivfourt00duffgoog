NOTES. 161

ram is used 101 tegrelae t'or metrical reasons, or may be used
collectively like κέραμος, ‘tilingt

aaa. 1011111111, ‘lay’: the word, rare in this sense, is commonly
used 01 living offspring: 01. Ovid Fast. ii 429 maritae Ι redde-
bant uteri pr'gnm rara παῖς itta iv 771 conceptaque semim coniunx
(the ewe) Ι reddat. Perhaps it is a metaphor from agriculture where
the word is constantly used, eg. Mart. ii 38 quid milri reddat ager, quaeris.

203—207. Codrus is a poor man but a lover 01 Greek art and
literature.

203. Procula minor, ‘too small 101 Procula': Procula is probably ,
the name of a dwarf ; so Corbulo stands 101 a giant (l. 251), Hispulla for a
fat lady (ra, rr). For the constr.. see n. 10 4, 66 privatis taratara facin

204. ornamentum abad, ‘to adom his sideboard’: the abacus was
a square table, in this casea marble slab, used 101 the display 01 plate3
it had a support, called τραπεζοφόρον, which was often a piece 01 ’
sculpture in marble, bronze, or silves. Codrus' sideboard rests on the
recumbent figure 01 a Centaur; he has no plate to display on it but
only six earthen pipkins. Yet it seems as it he might have placed his
beaker (cantharus) above the board and not below it.

It must be allowed that a recumbent figure would not make a good
support; hence some suppose that 011110 is the name 01 Codrus' dog.

205. marmore=abaea

206. lam goes closely with aetum when joined, like ἤδη, with
participles and adjectives, iam may be transl. ‘quite’z cs. Hor. Sat. i
1, 5 lamfraetus, ‘quite broken-down)

01110. 2 this serves 101 a scrinium which Codrus has not g0t3 that its
proper function was 10 hold clothes, appears from averse quoted by
Quintilian, viii 3, 19 praetextam in cesta errares rasere Camilli.

107. et may be transl. ‘where' as the Graeci libelli are identical
with the divina carnrina: both may well refer to Homer.

opici...muree‚ ‘barbarous Roman mice’: they do not spare the
Greek poems for their beauty. apici=ignorant 01 Greek: cf. 6, 455:
’0111κί0 is the old Greek name 101 Latium and Campania; and ὀπικοί was
applied to the Romans in the same disparaging sense as βάρβαροι 10
all non-Hellenic peoples. That it was resented, we see from Cato in
Pliny Nat. Hist. xxix ¹4 nas quaque dictitant barbaras [Graeei,] et
spurcius aas quam aleas apican appellatione foedant. For sudu an

epithet applied to nice, ct. Hor. Epp. i ao, 11 tineas inertes.

110. Prende wtmnae eat ; but est is expunged *oy une 00110ζὲ :xz

That the sentence is more vigorous without it, pruses neurim*
