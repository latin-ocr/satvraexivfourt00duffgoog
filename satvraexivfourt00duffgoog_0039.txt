powers3 but, as there was no long interval of time between the
third and fourth books, it is probable that Juvenal deliberately
‘discarded some of the means on which he had formerly relied to
produce his most striking effects.
The difference is seen both in form and substance. The

satires in the last two books are really letters, and not satires at
all: each is addressed to a friend ; there is no dialogue and little
dramatisation. The style is different, much less abrupt and
ellipticah The sentences are longer and more complicated;
there is far more repetition. N or is the contrast less striking,
when we consider the substance of the later satires. They are

moral essays: like the letters of Seneca, they are nominally
· addressed to a correspondent but deal in a general way with
such questions as ‘the value of prayer‚' ‘the desire of revenge,'
‘the influence of parents,’ and so on. Illustrations, which are
frequent, are taken, not from the Roman streets, but from Greek
history and mythology. The first nine satires present a
wonderfully vivid picture of life at Rome at the end of the

first century; the last seven have a different object, and the
notices of contemporary events are merely incidental. Read
the fifteenth satire after the first, and the differenee will seem
astonishing. ·

This unlikeness has given rise to a theory, originated
'half in jesr by Ribbeck¹, that a number of what pass for
Juvenal’s satires, were really written by an anonymous forger of
somewhat later date. If this jeu d'espn't were worthy of serious
refutation, it would be easy to show that, in spite of general
unlikeness‚ there are many minute resemblances, which a forger
would hardly have hit upon, between the earlier and later
satires. But a theory, which would have us believe that a
nameless booksellefs hack wrote the tenth satire, carries its
own refutation. lt is enough to say that authors, either ancient
or modern, are not confined to a single manner. If Juvenal
had chosen to call his later poems epistles, it is certain that
Ribbeck's theory would never have been given to the world.
