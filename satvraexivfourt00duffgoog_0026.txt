The third book contains the seventh, eighth, and ninth
satires. The first of these begins with the statement that the
prospects of literature, especially of poetry, depend entirely
upon the patronage of ‘Caesar’ The question thus arises, and
has been much discussed, which of the emperors is spoken of.
Now Trajan never returned alive from his Eastem campaigns
but died in Cilicia in 117. What more probable than that this
compliment was paid, on his accession, to Hadrian, the first
ruler since Claudius who was ‘a man of parts' and took a
serious interest in literature? Indeed, he was a poet himself,
and his ‘dying address to his soul’ has been famous in all
agesl. Some think Trajan is referred to, in spite of the
obvious chronological difficulty, and appeal to a passage in
Pliny2, where it is said that certain studia have got a new
lease of life under Trajan. But, as Friedlalnder shows, the
context proves that Pliny has in mind, not poetry, but philosophy
and rhetoric. Others go further back than Trajan for this
imperial patron of literature. Nettleship⁸ argues for Domitian.
lf this were so, it would show that the satires are not arranged
in anything like chronological order: the seventh must have
been written long before the fourth. It is probable that the
emperor addressed, whoever he was, had just succeeded to the
throne ; for, in the days of patronage, men of letters clung with
strange persistency to the belief that each new monarch must

prove a Maecenas Thus George the Third was certainly a bad “

judge of literature, yet we read in Boswell (11. p. 229, ed. 1874):
‘the accession of George the Third to the throne of these
