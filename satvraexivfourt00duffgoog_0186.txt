51. Vennum: the allusion is to Horace, a satirist of a very
different kind, who was born at Venusia ac. 65.

lucerna, ‘lamp’; ef. Hor. Epp. ii r, ueprius orto Ι sole aegil cala·
mum et chartas et scrinea posco. We should rather say ‘pen’y but
compare our use of ‘lucubration’

ψ 52. amun is used here in two senses: (1) am 1 to attaclr ; (a) am
l to deal with.

Heracleae and mamm are names of epics formed on the analogy
of Odysse'a from Odysseus. Theseus and the Minotaur, Daedalus and
Icarus are the stories referred to below. .

. 54. percussum pueros see u. to l. 13: puero is instrumental abl,
uotdat.: if it were dat, it would be=a puero which would give the wrong
sense. Icarus was notan agent at all in the matter, but a passive victim.
Of course the phrase adds to the sarcastic tone of the description.

fabrumque volantem, ‘the flying tinman': see n. on pelliculae 1. 11.

55. leno-is the husband who connives at his wife's dishonour.

sl captandus the wife was prevented by law from inheriting, not
because of her bad character, but because of her sex: the lex Voconia ¹
(169 uc.) originally enforced these disabilities against women. The law
could be evaded by bequeathing the estate to a third party in trust
for the woman; in the present case her own husband is the heres
fiduciarius, who got a share as such. capare=lteres esse, while accipere
is properly used of the provisional possession of the heresfiduc.

(But it is doubtful whether the lex Voconia was still in force3 and
Friedl. supposes that the woman had no children aud was therefore pre·
vented by the leges Iulia and Papia Poppaea from inberiting (see n. to
3, 116); though her husband could do so, if he had a child by a former
marriage.)

58. euram...oobortlsz the youth, who has spent all his money in
extravagance, hopes to repair his fortunes iu the army. For the army
as a profitable career, cf. 14, ¹93·

It was customary for both senators and knights to begin public life
with some service in the army. In the case of the former, the office
was tribunatus legionis and was often a mere form3 but the equites did
actually go through three successive steps in the army, known as the
equestres militiae: these were praefectura cohortis sociorum, tribunatus

agranta and propterera alae, usually in this order. They formed a pre·
lude to the lucrative and important posts in the civilserv'tee, uniusne
length„ riIIed as procuratores. Cf. Pliny Epp. vii ἰω Terentius lunas.
