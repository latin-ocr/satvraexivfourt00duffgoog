INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

to be reserved for the most venial faults3 improprieties and
hreaches of social convention are, in his eyes, worse than crimes.
When a Gracchus fought in the ¹arena as a gladiator, this is
expressly stated to be a greater disgrace to his order than the
most horrihle vices¹. Lateranus is fond of horses, and drives
himself, though not by day, along the public roads: he is placed
in the same list as the forger, the adulterer, and the spoiler of

the provincesl. A list of Nero’s crimes is given: his murders
come first, and his appearances on the stage form the climax³.
Nettleship aptly compares the paradox in De Quincey’s Artos
Marder: ‘if once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon
becomes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes

next to drinking and sabbath-breaking, and from that to in·
civility and procrastination' The philosophy which Juvenal
despised would have supplied him with a truer ethical standard,
Α and also been of service to him in other ways. He says, in·
correctly, that Zeno taught men to abstain from cannibalism⁴;
· the followers of Zeno could have taught him a more useful and
more difficult lesson, to give up national antipathies. For
Juvenal’s patriotism is of that narrow type which considers it a
virtue to hate foreigners: all orientals come under his ban, Jews,
Greeks, and, above all, Egyptians.

Thus it is impossible to claim for Juvenal that he was
willing, in his own words, ‘to sacrifice his life for the truth';
or that he had a delicate appreciation of shades of moral
delinquency; or that he was a man of wide sympathies. It
has been argued from the great licence of language which he
allows himself in attacking vice, that his· own morals were not
above reproach3 but such evidence is quite insufficient. It is
probable that he is here following the tradition of sutura. Even
Persius, of whose blameless life there is ample evidence, uses
language of this kind; and very inappropriate it seems in his

pagellhat then are the qualities which have gained for Juvenal
