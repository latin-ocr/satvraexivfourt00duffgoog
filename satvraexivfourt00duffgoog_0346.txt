282 JUVENAL, v11.

a lawyer brags most of his gains, either before a creditor of his own,
or before a litigant who comes, with a huge account-book, to prees
for payment of a debt: the latter ‘gives a fillip' to the advocate's
power of lying, as there is a chance of his getting the brief. ncrlor is
practicnlly=acrius the adu: he is the cause of greater keenness in the
barrister. Jahn brackets the 1. Friedl. (after the Schol.) supposes
l. 110 to refer to the barrister's banker who is doubtful of his client’s
credit.

110. dublum suggests a difficolt case, grandi erich client—both
of which circumstances promise a large fee.

codex is the book in which debtors’ names and their debts are
entered; hence menen is ‘debt' and noereina faeere ‘to leud money';
cf. Sen. de Ben. i 1, a noneina facturi diligenter patrimonium et man
debitoris inquirimus. The book is generally called Kolendorium in
prose: cf. Sen. Epp. 87, 7 magnur Kalendarii liber caluitum Mart. viii
44, 11 centum explicentur paginae Kalendarum.

111. The man's lungs are compared to a blacksmith's bellows, as
by Hor. Sat. i 4, 19 at tu conclusas hircinis follibus auras, Ι ...ut mavis,
imitare.

112. consummantum, ‘and they spit upon their breasts': this
wasa charm, to obviate the evil effects of boasting and to propitiate
Adrasteia: cf. Theocr. vi 39 (Polyphemus, after admiring his own
reflexion) air eripuerant& δέ, τρὶς eis ἐμὸν trauca eitra: Petron. 74
(Trimalchio, of the lady who has been luclry enough to become his wife)
at instat se tanquam rana, et in sinum suum non spuit.

This seems better than the other explanation, that they splutter in
their eagerness; the Scholiast gives both.

messem continues the metaphor of l. 103.

1¹3· patrimonia, ‘fortunes'; see n. to 12, 50.

114. paru alta=inde, ‘on the othe1·side'; cf. 6, 437 where itis
opposed to inde.

russati...1.ecertae: for russati, see n. to 11, 198. Lacerta is an
auriga or agitator in the circus: the name (which may have been borne
by many successive aurigae: see n. to Paridi l. 87) is found on a lamp
with the figure of an auriga. Martial also complains (x 74, 2) of the dis·
proportion between his gains, as a salutator, and those of a circus-driver,
quanuliu salutator Ι anteambulones et togatulos inter Ι centum mmebor
