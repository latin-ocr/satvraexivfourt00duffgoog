SATIRE XVI.

THE ADVANTAGES OF A MILITARY CAREER.

The Scholiast says ol this fragmentary Satire that many held it to
bc spurious and refused to allow that Juvenal wrote it. Most modern
critics believe in its authenticity. Not onlyis it found in all ress and
attributed to Juvenal by Servius and Priscian, who quote t'rorn it; but,
even if it were anonymus, a reader familiar with Juvenal’s style would
surely pronounce it to be his. The belief in fatalism, the banter at the
expense of the gods, the sustained irony which, undere mask ol praise, ν
points out the unjust privileges oi the soldier over the civilian-all these
are characteristic.

r. pnemlastadvantages'sit is not used here though often elsewhere
ol the pecuniary rewards given to soldiers on their discharge (missio):

et praemia flagitantes. Under Augustus a legionary received re‚ooo
sesterces (fimo) on his discharge: later the sum was probably less.

praetorian guard is meant. This force was recruited‚ as lar as possible,
in Italy; and the men received double the pay os the legionaries, and
could retire at an earlier age: ci. Tac. Ann. i 17·

3. excipiat is optative.

4. A lucky star does more for a soldier than a letter ol recommen· ’
dation sddressed to the God of War by his mistress, Venus, and his
mother, Juno. The significance ol hore is shown by 6, 581: the luck
is attached to a particular time.
