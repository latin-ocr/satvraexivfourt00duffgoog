Nouus 127

a dole given in Bithynian towns to guests on special occasions, the
amount being one or two deurit. Thtoughout Juv., the dole seems
always to be money, not eatables: cf. 1. 118.

Two discrepantias have been noticed between Juv.’s account of the
sportula aud Martial’s: (r) that the former speaks of the distribution in
the morning, not the evening; (a) that he includes nobles, magistrates,
and women among the recipients, whereas Martial does not. Aa to
the first difficulty, it seems natural and probahle, that those who saw
no more of their patron after the salutatu, received their sportula then,
in the early morning; whereas the anteambulonrs, who attentet their
patron throughout the day, received their's at the end of their laboura,
often in the bath itself(cf. Mart. iii 7, 33 x 70, 13). The other difficulty
may fairly be disposed 01 by supposing that, after Martial had turned his
face westwards, it became the custom to distribute the sportula to all.
without distinction, who attended the salutatio. That one great man
attended the salutatio 01 another great man, is perfectly established by
many passages from both authors.

our own old chronicles generally begin our history with the arrival of
Brut the Trojan in England.
