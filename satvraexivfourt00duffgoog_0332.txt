SATIRE Vll.

THE TROUBLES OF LITERARY MEN.

1-35. There is no prospect for menos letters except the emperor’s
patrenage. De'stingm'shed ports hove been forced ty imminent rtur·
walion to take up most prosaic occupatiorrs; even thisr's better than
to live by perjury. But now there will he a different state os things,
when the emperor is eager to reward merr‘t. Otherwise, poete might
as well burn their writings, for the rich will gr‘ve them nothing hut
praise. Meanwhile, the poet grows old in poverty, and learns to
curse his genius. ⁴

lt is urged by Friedltnder that this introduction has no real
connexion with what follows. First, whereas the introduction insists
on an improvement in the position os literary rnen, owing to the
emperor’s interest in thern, the body of the satire goes on to depict
the present position ol all this class as utterly hopeless. Secondly,
whereas the satire deals with literary men of every kind, the introduction

neaks only os poets and poetry. F riedl. concludes that the satire was
ritten under Trajan, and the introduction added when Hadrian
cended the throne.

The argument is not convincing. Juv. is careful to point out that

he emperor is the only patron literature can expect (tontum 1. 1, solus
l. a) ; and one swallow does not make a summer. The attach on the
selfish nobles, which pervades the whole satire, is not inconsistent with
the preliminary compliment to the emperor, a compliment based mainly
⁵on a sense ol favours to come.

1. ‘All the prospects os literature and all the inducements to it
depend on the Emperor! ln the absence ol other means of dating the
satire, there has been much discussion as to which emperor is meant, as

one in particular seems plainly referred to. See lutrod. p. rut.
