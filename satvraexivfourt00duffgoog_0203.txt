25. Daedalus: cl. Virg. Aen. vi ¹4 Daedalus, utsama est, fugr'enr
Minoia regna, Ι ...insuetum per iter gelidas enavit ad Arctos, Ι Chaladi-
caque levis tandem superadscieit arce, i.e. at Cumae. The roundabout
description of Cumae isto be noticed: Juv. has a great liking lor
describing places and persons by a periphrasis giving some historical -
or mythological details about them. cf. the periphrasis lor Tarsus
l. 117, lor Aeneas 5, 45, for Palestine 6, 159, sor Pluto 10, 112, for Alba
η, 70, and many others.

27. dum...torqueat‚ i.e. while 1 have some lile left: when tlre
Fate has spun all the wool, the man¹s lile is over: cf. Mart. i 88, 9
cum mihi cuprenses Lachesis pcrmcverc't annos (=cum mortuus ero).

29. of Artorius and Catulus nothing is known.

31. This probably refers to the crcratores n'pmum et alvei Tiberis
et cloacemm urbis: the curatores were senators but would emplo'y con·
tractore who might cheat the govemment.

32. The cleansing of sewers was generally done by convicts; it is
described by Trajan (ad Plin. 32, a) as one of the ministeria quae non
longe a poena sunt; and we see that discredit fell also on the contractors
(mancipes, redemptores) who had this work done.

A Roman funeral was generally performed by contract, in many
cases by the Lr'bitc'naria', a guild of undertakers who had their head·
quarters at the temple of Libitina. This calling also was discreditable,
which seems less reasonable.

33. ‘And to be sold up beneath the spear of ownership’; this
applies to all the contracts above-mentioned ε they accept each and all
of them, embemle the money, and make a fraudulent bankruptcy: cl.
cedere fero 11, 50, and Plaut. Persa 435 (os the bankers ol the day) ubi
quid credideris, citius extemplo scra Ι fragrant, quam ex sporta (Palmer,
parta mss.) ludr's quom emissust lepus.

domina...hasta: a spear, as the symbolos conquest aud ownership,
was stuck up at state-auctions: in Italian arta means ‘an au'ction,'
not ‘a spear': we speak ol ‘the hammer.’ An auction of this kind,
i.e. a bankrupt sale where the state sold the bankrupt's property, was
called sectab3 and at it, the hasta took the place ol the aes et libra ol an
ordinary sale. The lrasta is called domina, because the purchasers at a
sectio acquired legal ownership (duracmum), just as il they had bought
the property per aes et libram: cf. Sen. Centeno. ii 1, 1 limina...sub
mino scetere vermle'a.

The ‘spear’ was also stuclr up in the chiel civil const ethome, taxe
centumviri, which for this reason is olten called hosta, eg. Β* ”’
