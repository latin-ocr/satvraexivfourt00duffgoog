316 Juvenum, vni.

The ‘Ghost' 01 Catullus was a ‘noisy’ mimus, perhaps owing to
the screams ol the characters to whom the ghost appeared. For
Phasma, cl. Plautus’ Mostellaria (the story 01 the martellum 01· ghost),
which was founded on a Greek original called Φάσμα.

casuum was a well-known sarae-writer 01 the Neronian age; cf. 13,
111 ς Mart. v 30, 3 facundi scena Catulli.

187. Laureolus was a famous highwayman, whose crucifixion was
represented in Caligula’s reign in a mimus which seems to have become
a stock-pieee: cl. Suet. Cal. 57 and Mart. Eprg. Lz'b. 7, 4 non falsa
pendam in cruce Laureolus.

velox, ‘nimble'2 either (1) because activity was required to preserve
the illusion, 01 (1) because Laureolus was a fugitivus: lor the latter,
cl.13, 111. ”

The Lentuli Cornelii were a high patrician family.

189. ignoscas, ‘ought you to pardon'3 see n. to expectes r, ¹⁴·
itone dunos: the lorehead is regarded as indicating modesty or the
want ol it; ci. the common phrase perfricui frontem, ‘I lay modesty
aside’: see n. to 13, 141.

190. triscurria: the prefix intensifies the meaning, as in τρίδουλος,
tmsurcifer etc.

191. planipedes, ‘barefooted': tragic actors wore a high boot
(cothurnus), comic actors a low shoe (saccus); the actors in mimi wore
no covering on the loot. The Fabii and Mamerci are given as types 01
noble birth; a Mamercus was the original ancestor ol the gens Aemilia.

19²· alapw an invariable feature in the mimus was the blows
bestowed upon the stupellas, a stoclr character in these pieces, who
represented such parts as a deceived husband (see n. to 6, 276), and, like
our Pantalcon, came in 101 all the kicks and blows; cl. Mart. v 61, 11
a quam dagnus eras alapis, Mariana, Latini. (The quotation shows
that Mamercorum may mean ‘dealt by the M.’)

quanti sua funera vendant etc. Much has been written on this
difficult passage. The primary lact to realise is, that Juv. is not here
speaking 01 nobles fighting as gladiators; that topic begins at l. ¹993
here he is dealing only with appearances on the stage. Two serious
difficulties romain, in quanti, and sua funera vendant. With regard to
the latter, such examples as letum (arvitam) pacisci seem quite unlike:
s. f. vendant is not :vitam suam redimant, 101 vendant must be used in
the same sense as in 1. 193 (cl. l. 185 and 6. 380), where the meaning

clearly cannot be that lile 'ts gained as lhe price ol degradation„ asina.
expressly says there is now no compulsion, no leur cl mlu- madere,
