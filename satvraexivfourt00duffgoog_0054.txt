These instances give some idea os the superiority of P over
the other MSS, because even where it now gives a corrupt
reading, we see that in many cases this is the fault of the
corrector. Next let us give some of the many instances where
the corrector has, no doubt by oversight, failed to alter the true
reading to what is found in ω. ’

In Sat. 7, 99 all MSS. but P read petit hic plus temporis
atque olei plum P gives perit sor petit. The first reading is
good Latin; but the second is obviously right. Itis a version
of the common proverb perdere oleum, which no copyist could
have hit upon suo Marte. Again‚ in Sat ις, 27 P rightly reads
Iunco where nearly all the other Mss. read Iunio. In the first
place, there is no instance in the textos Juvenal of a word like

Iunio scanning as a spondee: see notes to Satt. 6, 82; 7, 185.
Next, we know that an Aemilius Iuncus was consul in October

127 aaa, a date which suits the context persectly. Lastly‚ the
oldest authority sor any part of Juvenal's text, the Bobio
palimpsest in the Vatican, written ln capitals‚ happens to contain

this line with fifty-one others, and reads Iunco. Many similar
instances will be found in the apparatus criticus.

But it must not be supposed that the corrector did nothing
but corrupt the text. There were many mistakes in P. First,
there were many omissions os letters, words, and parts of lines:
all these are filled in by the corrector. Further, certain letters
were constantly confused in P: l is often written lor i, tfor ι’,
v sor b: thus it gives locari for iocari (3, 40) and conversely
iaculis for loculis (1, 89): despictat for despiciat (5, 82): vervum
sor verbum (1, 161). These are harmless blunders, which can
easily be detected. Yet they have sometimes led to more
serious corruptions, of which there is a striking example iu
tiat8, 148. All mss. there read multo sufflamine consul 3 yet
he true reading, preserved by the Scholiast and the St Gall
‘'lon'legium, is s. mulio consul. The process ol corruption is
his: in the archetype os our MSS. mulio had become ntult0;
Ι and then the serious corruption was made by the reader who,
²¹ to save the scansion, transposed the two words, and thereby
made restoration almost hopeless. But the artifices of the
