PREFACE. iii

in ω (the two are very often identical), are found also in
this ns, It has an important variant in Sat. 8, 148 where
see note. '
The second us, also of the 9th century, is in the
Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (Ο, 4, 11). Itis
imperfect, a quire of eight having been lost which contained
from Sat. 6, 45 5 to Sat. 7, 95. This isa worse Ms. than the
¹ first, adhering still more closely to the interpolated tradition.

A few marginal variants from some good source (eg.
auditor for adiutor 3, 322: torrentis for torpentis 4, 43 3
ἱ figuli for tegulae 4, 1353 Iunco for Iunio 15, 27) are its most
ᾗ interesting feature3 buta complete collation of it would
ἰ add little to Hosius' material.

The third ns, of the roth century, is preserved in the
same Library (Ο, 4, ιο), and is a document of much greater

r value 'and interest: indeed Ι believe that, though vastly

i inferior to P, it ranks among the very best os the other
Ῑ uss. T,as Ι have called it, gives for the first time ns.

i authority for the true reading in Sat. 6, 13, and in a number

of cases, recorded in the apparatur to this edition, conrirms
the reading of P. It obviously belongs to the same family
as V and B of Hosius but is much better than either of
them, and perfect while they are both mutilated. I hope
soon to publish a full collation elsewhere.

l No emendation of my own is printed in the text, hut a
J certain number are suggested in the notes: a list will be
,· y found in the Index. They are not mere guesses, but based
r on some peculiarity in the reading of P, oron the agreement
2! in error of P and T, oron some hint contained in the
ς’. ancient Scholia. The punctuation has been dealt with
ς freely; but when an alteration has been made that affects
1 the sense, the reasons for alteration have been explained

ᾗ, in a note.
