398 JUVENAL, xiii

5 3. admirabilis, ‘astonishiug’3 cf. admiratio 6, 646.

55. vetulo non adsurrexerat: for the consta, cf. Sen. Dial.
iv τι, 8 lange...ab nuncnune pueritia removenda est. ...maioribus ad-
surgat. It is a complaint commonly heard in all ages, that the young
are not so respectiul to their elders as they used to be.

56. summoue is used as an indefinite pronoen: see n. to

iicet etc, although his parents were richer in the simple things in
which wealth then consisted.

57. uaga...gtanctie: ci. Ovid Met. i ¹04 (os the goldeu age)
arbuteos fetus montanaque fraga legebant, Ι et quae deciderant patula
Iovis arbore glandes.

59. adeo modifies par, just as tam does uenerabile in thel. above.

61. veterem...follem, ‘the old leather bag,’ in which the money
was originally handed over.

cum tota aerugine, ‘rust and all’: ci. 6, 171 curu teta Cartbagine3
14, 61 cum tota...tela: the aerugo gethers of c'ourse, not on the bag, but
on the money.

62. prodigiosa ndea, ‘such honesty is a portent‚' and therefore
needs that the lore os the haruspices be consulted, to tell us what god

⁸ nceds to be appeased by sacrifice: ci. a, 121 (of the portentous vices of
the nobles) a proceres, censore opus est an haruspice nobis? The Tusci
libelli are probably the books in which this learning was contained,
called by Cicero Etruscorum libri barernbicini et fielgurales3 some
explain as ‘the calendar oi portents.’ extispicium, with many other
Roman customs and rites, was adopted irom Etruria: acertain Tages
had the credit oi being conditor artis.

63. coronata=immalanda, as victims for sacrifice were crowned
with garlands.

64—70. All the portents here mentioned occur in Livy and other
ancient authorities. Juv. gives this long list in mockery; and, a century
earlier, Livy explains to his own sceptical age why he records the
portents of each year: xliii 13, 1 etmihi vetustas res scribenti nescio quo
pacto antiquus fit enimus, ct quaedam religio tenet, quae illi prudentissimi
viri (the wise men oi old) publice nesapicnda censuerint, ea pra indignis
babere quae in meas arinates reseram.

bimembris means either ‘with superfluous limbs’ (Livy osten records

- the portent of a biceps puer), or ‘hali-human,' the word being applied
iu this sense to the Centaurs: ci. Livy xxvii rr, geum elephanti capite

puerum natum.
