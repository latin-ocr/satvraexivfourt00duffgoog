Τ113 3101133 told by Pliny 01 M. Aquilius Regulus, a marr 01 3333101131
131111 (Pliny Epp. ii 203 iv 3, 3) would pass belief, 11 the whole literature
011113 time did not bear witness to their truth. The practice was
common in Horace's time: 31. Epp. i 1, 77 31131 qui Ι frustis et potiris

130. salutet: the first two hours 01 tlre day at Rome were devoted
to this 303131 duty; the callers had 10 wait in the vestibulum until the
atrium was throwu open ; but they were osten disappointed 01 seeing
the great marr, who might be disinclined to rise or might have gone

off to pay calls himself. The explanation 01 this custom is to be found
partly irr the unwillingness 01 the hurnhler Romans under the empire

to gain 3 small but honest living by trade. Though the old names
01 ‘patron' and ‘client' were retained, the relationship was entirely
changed: and both sides tried to give as little and get as much 33
they could3 the patron got some social importance from a swarm 01
1313111313 who received 111 return a small sum as daily wages.
