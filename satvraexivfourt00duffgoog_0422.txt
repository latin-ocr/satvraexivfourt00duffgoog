358 Juvsuau, x.

catalla, sc. lectas: for an empress itis covered with purple (Tyrius).
The lectus genialis (also called adversata because it stood opposite the
door) was not used as a bed, as is shown from the fact that it stood in
the atrium, but was placed there as a symbol of marriage: cf. Hor. Epp
i ι, 87 lactus genialis in aula est (=if he is married), Ι nil ait esse prius,
melius m‘l caelibe vata: but it might be used as a seat: cf. Prop. r 11, 85
seraranan adversum mutarit ιὀννυο lectum, Ι sederit at nostra emta ,
noverca tara. hortis, probably the gardens of Lucullus on the Pinciau
Hill: in order to get them Messalina had caused the death of their
owner, Valerius Asiaticus (Tac. Anu. xi 1). Tac. does not say that the
marriage took place there, but that on the return of Claudius to Rome
from Ostia, Messalina took refuge in these gardens and was killed there

335. ritu...anr1quo: the transference of the dowry to the husband
was part of the ancient legal ceremony; the amount of the dowry sm
this case and 6, 137 a million sesterces or Aso,ooo; in a, 11⁷ quadrin-
genta or A4,ooo) is not material.

³3⁶· samsom are friends who attend the ceremony (ffu‘um) in
order to sign the marriage-contract (tabulae) ; see nn. to 3, 823 6, ²5.
Τλο auspex gave the sanction of heaven to the nuptials, taking the ’
omens before the marriage and performing a sacrifice as part of the
ceremony. On this occasion, as on others in private and public life

’ under the empire, divination was practised by the inspection of entrails,
not hythe flight of birds, though the diviner was still called auspex, not
haruspex. Messalina was determined to have everything done in proper
form (legitimam cf. Tac. Anu. xi 27 adhibitis qui obsignarent,..iltam
auda'sse auspicum verba ; Suet. Claud. 26 quam, cum compm'sset C. Silio
atram nupsisse, dote inter auspices consignata, supplicio afficit.

(Mr Lendrum suggests that the business of the auspcx was not to
sacrifice hut to speak words of good omen: he compares Tac. 1. l.
auspicum verba with Juv. a, ¹¹9 signatae tabulae, dutum ‘ feliciter! ’)

337. tu must refer to Silins; the line is somewhat awkwardly in·
serted here.

338. quid is used for utrum: see n, to 8, 196.

339. ante lucernas, ‘before lamps are lit,’ ie. before dark: similar
expressions for denoting time (eg. περὶ λύχνων ἁφάς Herod. vii 215,
περὶ πρῶτον ὕπνον Thuc. ii a, περὶ πλήθουσαν ἀγοράν Xen, βουλυτόνδε
Hom.) were commonly used hythe ancients in default of a more aocu·
rate method of reckoning hours. They may still be heard in country
districts; eg. in Scotland ‘the milkin' o* thekye‘ 'rs ν w-lluuderasmd

bour of the day.
