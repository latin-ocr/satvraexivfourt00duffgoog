by giving the anulus to their own lreedmen. If a man possessed his

Asia, the Roman province, does not include Cappadocia or
Bithynia.

15. Bithyni: the first syll. is long elsewhere: so ro, 1623 15, 1:

hence some edd. transpose Β. and Arriani ; Biich. proposes fuerantque
equites Bith. Also, as Bithynia is quite distinct t'rom Galatia, the
insertion of ct alter Bithyni (so Weise) seems desirable.

ankles. A horde ol Gauls crossed over into Asia about 280 ae.

Papal Chancery, inheriting the word from the imperial court, made it
{amous in another sense.

ra. rerum, ‘fortunes’

operanda: so A. E. Housman (Class. Rev. iii p. τοι) ior spectanda

' ol P, and expectanda os other uss: the Scholiast seems to have read

Sexte? quid aut speras aut petis inde? refer.

sperareis ‘to look for'; spectare, ‘to look at)
