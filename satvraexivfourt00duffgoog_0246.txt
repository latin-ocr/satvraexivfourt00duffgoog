182 Juvenum ru.

an interesting account of this office in Tacitus (Arm. vi ro and 11). ln
Republican times the title was given as a mere compliment to any young
man os rank; he had no real powers but was supposed to be the formal
representative of the consuls during their compulsory absence from Rome
sor the ceremonies of theseriac Latrim on the Alban Mount. Augustus
conferred the title upon the holder of a really great office: the praefectio
urbi was regularly a consular, and the post was the crown of the consular
career. It was held for a number of years, sometimes for lise. This
magistrate had represented Augustus during his absences from Rome,
and, during the latter years of Tiberius’ reign had become the greatest
power in the state next to the emperor.

attonitae does not express the surprise of the city at P. ’s appoint-
ment but the reign of terror caused by Domitian's ferocity3 cf. 11, 199.

positus would be praepositus in prose.

vilicus: where all were slaves (cf. l. 38), the chief magistrate could
only be called a slave-driver and a slave himself.

78. anua, sc. erant quam vilici ?

quorum: the plur. does not necessarily mean that there was more
than one praefectus urbi at the same time. There is an isolated state-

a very late writer whose unsupported evidence is worth little. Juv.
may be comparing Pegasus with his predecessors in office, or may be
thinking os the equestrian praefecti as well: see n. to l. 32.

79. quamquam: see n. to l. 60 ; the clause introduced by it here
is adverbial.

80. inermi, ‘without her sword 'z this isa criticism on P.; though
good and honest, he was too weak to fill his place properly in such
troublous times.

81. Vibius Crispus, vir ingenii siccandi et elegantis says Quintilian,
who gives an instance of his wit (v 13, 48). Tacitus (Hist. ii ιο) calls
him ‘great rather than good? When Domitian had just succeeded his
brother, Crispus was asked by a courtier whether anyone was then in
presence of the emperor; he replied, ne musca quidem, alluding to
the imperial passion for hilling flies (Suet, Doni. 3). With Crispi
senectus, comp. spatium rhombi in l. 39.

82. mlta ingenium, ‘a gentle spirit,' is in apposition with Crispi
senatus.

84. comes &maris is used technically like anticus Caesaris; when
