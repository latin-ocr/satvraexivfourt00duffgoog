to his appearances as a tragic actor, not as aeitharoedus: he chose at
least one appropriate part, cf. Suet. Nero ar inter cetera coartavit...
Oresten matn'cidam.

aar. Troica, an epic poem by Nero describing the fall of Troy,
recited by him in the poetical competition founded by himself 65 an.
Μ. suggests that the ἅλωσις Ἰλίου, which Nero declaimed, while Rome
was buming (Suet. Nero 38), may have been an extract from this poem;
but the ἅλωσις Ἰλίου seems to have been a tragedy.

Verginius: in the year 69 Julius Vindex, legate of Gallia Lugdu·
nensis, revolted against Nero and offered the throne to Galba the
future emperor, then govemor of Hispania Tarraconensis3 Verginius
Rufus, legate of Upper Germany, marched against Vindex and utterly
defeated him3 though he fought for Nero then, he afterwards acquiesced
in Nero's deposition, and hence is coupled here with Vindex and Galba.
He refused the throne for himself on two different occasions, and died
as a private citizen of the highest distinction Α. 1). 97. He was honoured
with a public funeral, and a laudatio was pronounced over his remaius
by Tacitus, consul in that year.

223. quod for quid of lass. is due to Madvig, who also removed the
mark of interrogation after Galba l. aaa.

The antecedent of quod is quid in l. aar: sor the form of sentence,
cf. Cic. Phil. xii 5 quid autam non integrum est sapienta, quod restitui
potest?

2²5· peregrina ad pulpita: Nero made a progress in Greece
which lasted a whole year an. 67-68; the calendar was altered so
that all the great Greek games might fall within the same year ; at all
of them he entered as a competitor in various contests and, as a matter
of course, gained the·prize; he brought 1808 crowns back to Rome.

226. arcentur, ‘to prostitute himself) apium: the prize at
Nemea was a wreath of parsley (σέλινον).

, ιι8. Domiti: Nero belonged to the gens Domitia; until his
adoption by Claudius a. D. 50, his name was L. Domitius Ahenobarbus,
and after that Ti. Claudius Nero Caesar. The founder of the family is
here meant; cf. Suet. Naro 1 Aenobarbi auctorem originis itemque
cognominis habant L. Domitium.

229. syrma (σύρμσ from σύρειν) is the long trailing robe worn by
tragic actors; cf. 15, 303 Thyestes, Antigone, and Melanippe (the
subject of two lost plays of Euripides) were tragic parts acted by mero.
