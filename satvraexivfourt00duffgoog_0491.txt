media de nocte :post sectam baram, ‘alter midnight' : so dc meridie,
‘in the astemoon’ ; diem dc dic differre, ‘to put off day aster day.'

That it was the custorn ol diligent Romans to ariticipate the day in
winter, we know from the practice os the elder Pliny, Pliny Epp. iii 5, 8
lucubrare Vulcanalibus (August ²3) incipiebat, ...statim a nocte multa,
hicme vcra ab bora septima (r am). ...aute lucem ibat ad Vespasianum
imperaturam nam ille quoquc noctibus utebatur.

191. cerae, ‘tablets’ lor writing 0113 see u. to 7, ug. The proles·
sions indicated are those os a barrister (causas age), and ol a jurisconsult.
That Juv. in the 7th satire represents these professions as anything but
lucrative, isan inconsistency which need not trouble us.

192. rubras..1egea: the first words os a law were written in red,
as also the first words or letters of medieval Mss; hence our ‘rabdos'
the directions in the Prayerhook which were often printed in red. Cf.
Petron. 46 cmi argo uuuc puero aliquot libra rubn'cata, quia volvellum...
aliquid a'c iurc gustare: the whole chapter gives a lively picture ol such
a father as Juv. is describing here. ’ ’

oi centurion, the vitis being the attribute of this officer: seen. to

naeuus is the regular word ior ‘petitiou’z the imperial secretary
who dealt with them was called a libellis.

Under the empire, a man of equestrian birth, who wished to enter
the civil service, had first to serve in the army in three successive grades,
for which see n. to 1, 58. Eventually, a fourth grade preliminary to
the others was added, that ol canturio. When these grades had been
completed, theman was entitled a quattuor militiis and became eligible
sor civil appointments, especially those ol procurator or praefectus.
Candidates lor these military offices were called militiae (sc equestris)
petitores: cs. Suet. Gramm. 24 M. Valerius Probus dia centuriatum petiit
donec taedia ad studuit se contulit.

It appears, however, that the youth mentioned here is notos eques·
trian rank but a member of the plebs ; cs. 8, 47 and Livy there quoted.
For in the case of an eques, this military service was not a serious profes·
sion, but a mere passport to more lucrative civil employments. But the
context shows that the youth here spoken of is to remaiu in the army
all his active lise and retire as a primzpilaris (see ιι. tol. 197). This
post was the highest ambition ol a common soldier, who nomme
way up by degrees; audit must have been a rare prece ot {mmmm
tbrsucb a man to begin his service in the army even a& m mmm ὓ
