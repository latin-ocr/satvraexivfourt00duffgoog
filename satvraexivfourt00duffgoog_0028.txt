Juvenal was born between 60 and 72 ab. He himself in his
first satire¹ speaks of his youth as already past, and in the
eleventh² uses the language of an old man. The date of his
death is quite uncertain, except that it cannot have been earlier
than 128.

When we turn to the satires themselves, not for dates, but
for facts in Juvenal's life, we find that there is little to be
learned. ln this respect, as in many others, he does not follow
the example of previous satirists. The satires of LuciliuS, as
we know from Horace³, gave a complete picture of their author's
life; and Horace's own satires and epistles are full of autobio·
graphy. But Juvenal's manner is solemn and didactic‚ not
chatty and anecdotic. We learn from himself little more than
this: that he had the usual education os the higher classes

(ι, 15-17); that he lived from early youth at Rome but went
for holidays to Aquinum, with which he had some connexion
(3, 319) 3 that he inherited a small estate (6, 57) and had a
small farm at Tibur, probably distinct froin the other· (11, 66) ;·

that he had also a house in Rome where he entertained his
friends in a modest way (11, 190); that he was not a professed
follower of any philosophie school (13, 121-123); and that he
had been in Egypt (15, 45).

Two tolerably certain inserences may also be drawn from
what he says or leaves unsaid: that he was unmarried, and
that he understood from experience the hardships of poverty
and dependence. lt appears that he did not inherit much of
the wealth of the libertinus of Aquinum. The circumstances of
Martial's life were very similar: he also was a inan of letters
living in Rome and probably unmarried; and, though the
owner of a small estate, he has never done complaining of his
poverty and the hardshipsof a client’s life.
