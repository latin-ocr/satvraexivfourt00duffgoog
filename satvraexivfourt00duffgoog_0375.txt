146-182. Here is another instance of miscondnct in a man of noble
birth. Lateranus, the consul, doives himself along the public matis.
He does this hy night 5 when he ccases to hold office, he will act
coachman in the light of day. He visits the night-honses, an
honoured guest in thot low company. Nor has he the excuse of
youth: he is a man of full age who might he semiceahle to he's
country. Eocn a slave, roho had snch a passion for had company,
would he punished; hut aristocrats panion such conduct in them·
solves.

L's crime consiste in driving himself instead of being driven: cf.
r, 61 nam lora tenebat 1 ipse: the charge seems to us trifling‚ but Juv.
osten attacks undignified conduct as fiercely as the worst vices: cs.
Ι. ooo, and see Introd. p. xxxvii.

146. He drives along the public made, eg. Appia and Flaminia,
and there passes the tombs of his ancestorsi see n. to r, 171.

147. carpento: this was a two-wheeled, comfortable carriage,
drawn by two hosses.

Lateranus: cf. ro, 17: Plautius Lateranus, when consul designate
in 65 mn, was implicated in Piso's conspiracy against Nero and put to
death. No Lateranus occurs in the Fasti os Nero's reign 3 T. Sextius
Lateranus was consul 94 A.1).; but the reference to Nero l. 170 shows
that he cannot be meant here; so Juv. probably refers to the consul
designate, of whom Tacitus speaks favourably (Ann. xv 60)..

148. mulio consul: all edd. before Buch. (1886), read multo
sufflamine c.‚ no other reading being known; but the Florilegium os
St Gall (see Introd. p. xliii), which includes this line, reads as in the
text3 and this is confirmed (ι) by a Schol. on l. 157, quia mulio est qui
consul fertur, (a) by a late grammarian, who, in order to show that
mulio can be a dactyl, quotes srom Juv. mulio consul. The reading is
certainly right: multo sufflamineis meaningless. ln P the true reading
has been erased. For the cause of corruption, see Introd. p. xliv.

(A 9th century MS. of Juv. in the British Museum (no. 15600) reads

mulio sufflamine consul: ntulio being a correction, apparently os multo.)
149· quidem, ‘it is true! testeo is taken by M. to be nom.; it
may, however, be accus. agreeing with oculos. For oculos, cf. M.
Amold’s Obcrmonn ‘and on his grave with shining eyes Ι the Syrian
stars look down.'
