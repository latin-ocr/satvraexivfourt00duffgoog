ω’ for P, the worse reading for the better, as he used a MS.
of the inferior class to correct by. Many passages, however,
have escaped his mistaken zeal; and, even where the change
has been made, the erasure does not always entirely conceal
the original reading.

There is also another source from which the true reading
has in many cases been retrieved‚ and which throws light on
the surpassing merit of P.

This is afforded by the ancient Scholia, which are preserved
in P. The corrector, while altering and corrupting the text,
did not trouble to alter the Scholium, or note in the margin,
which still remains to prove the corruption. Thus in Sat. 1,2
all MSS· read Codri; but the Scholium in P, immediately
opposite the text, gives Cordi. Turning to the text of P, we see
the word is written Co dri: the inference is clear that the true
form of the name is Cordi, and that it was originally found in
P, before the corrector erased the r and changed i to ri, as he
could easily and neatly do. The corrector was haunted by the
recollection of Codrus in Sat. 3, 203 foll, and made up his
mind that Juvenal meant the same person here By another
ill-timed exercise of memory he changed trudentur tubera in
Sat„ 5, 116 to roduntur l, which gives no sense ; but rodere
tubera of Sat. 14, 7 was in his mind. Take another instance of
help from the Scholia ln Sat. 8, 155 all MSS. read toruumque
iuuencum, but in the Scholium of P we find robumque i. We
next find that in P the first letters of the adjective are a
correction lor something else. We infer that the corrector,
innocent of evil intention, struck out rob· and substituted loru,
which he found in his Ms. of the inferior class, toruum having
been originally a ‘ gloss’ or explanation of the rare word robum.
And the reading has in this case external confirmation; a‘ ¹
it is found in the Florilegium Sangallense, a St Gall MS
containing selections from Juvenal; for even in the Middl
Ages the satirist had to submit to expurgation, and there att
many such Flort'legr'a. If this last ΜΒ. gave the whole text f
the satires, it would be a worthy rival of P itself : it is ⁰r
source of the reading multo consul in Sat. 8, 148.
