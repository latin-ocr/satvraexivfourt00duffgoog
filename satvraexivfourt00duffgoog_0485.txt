102. Moyses: cf. Tac. 1.1.4 Moyses, qno sili in posterum gentem
firmaret, nouos ritus contrariosque ceteris mortalibus indidit.

103, 104. The Jewish Law is misrepresented as consisting solely of
prohibitions against showing the commonest offices of humanity (what
Petronius calls tralati'co'a humanitas) to any but co-religionists. These
good offices are often mentioned as due from all men to their kind: cf.
Cincio Orat. i ²03 ut commonstrarem tantum neom et, ut fieri solet,
digitum adsontis intenderem3 Sen. de Ben. iv 29, 1 ergo...nec aquam
haurire permittes, nee aiam erranti monstrabis ingrato? (ie. is the
ungrateiul man to be considered as outside the pale of humenityi).

105. pater in muse, ‘ the father (oi the proselyto) is to blame':
here, as in the other cases, a bad example has been followed and
made worse: the sother was content with keeping the sabbath and
abstaining from pork, the son carries out Ιῒο the full the inhumanity of
his sect.

106. Tacitus (1.1. 4) takes the same view oi the Jewish Sabbaih
and Jubilee‚ that they were prompted by indolence: septimo die otium
placuisse serunt, quia is finem laborum (ie. their wandering in. ihe
wilderness) tulerit ; dein blandiente inerti'a septimum quoque annum
ignaviae datum ⁴

usse is used for ‘the business of lite’ The subject to ottifflt is lux,
not qni supplied irom nei: the proselyte was no doubt active enough on
the other days oi the week. ‚

roy—255. Other oi'ces are readily imitated by tlte young, but ovarice
they need to be taught. And this instmection is systematicolly
imparted by parents. Laoc of money and desire for weoltlt groco
apoee. Injustice to others and consequent disrepute are of no account
to tic man roho is in haste to be rich, and sor whose wants the
simplicity osan earlier ogeis quite insufficient. When yon urge
your son to graio rich, to make money tris first object, you meost not
be surpessed if tte betters your instruction und conemits perjury and
even murder sor money. Your own lise will not be safe, if yon
persist in living on when your son, too apt a pupil, is eager to
inierit your weattlr.

108. quoque, ‘even’ against their will. He fact that there is no
caesura after the 3rd foot in the verse, isdisguised by the elision: ro,
358 is similar.
