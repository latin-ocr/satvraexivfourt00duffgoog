54· tanti...non ut...narena ramat somno careas ‘do not
regard the sand os Tagus as so great a prize‚ that you should be willing
to lose your sleep for it.’ The constr. tanti est ut...g0es through a
peculiar development. In its original sorm, which we have here, the
subject os the tanti est clause is the prise zoe wale ta gain, while the ut
clause expresses the price we leave ta pay; here the prize is wealth, and
the price paid for it is peace of mind. Cf. 10, 97 quae praeclara et
prospera tanti, {atrebas laetis par se't mensura malarum? lt must be
observed that in this form of the constr„ the ut clause is elliptical, and
in English we must supply the notion of ‘being willing’: ut somno
careas is elliptical for ut santna carere aeles3 and ut rebus laetis etc. is
elliptical sor utprapterea parem quis esse velit mensuram malarum. Cf.
also Ovid Met. x 618 tanti...putat conubia nostra Ι ut pereat, ‘he thinks a
marriage with us so great a prize that he is willing to pay for it with his
life‚' where ut pereat is elliptical sor ut pen're velit.

In the second form of the constn, the meaning of the two clauses is
exactly reversed; for the subject of the tanti est clause represents the

price to be pald, while the ut clause expresses the prize to be gained.
The change of meaning is probably due to the use ol tanti est without
any expressed subject, and without an ut clause: in such cases the true
meaning os the phrase became obscured. The second form, or a part ol

it, occurs once in Juv. 13, 95 et phthisis et aaneieae putres et dimidiam
’ crus Ι sunt tanti, sc. ut teneam nummos, ‘disease and deformity are a

price worth paying sor the prize os keeping the money unlawfully.‘ The

ut is osten represented by dum maala, and the ut clause is often sup·
pressed altogether.

The distinction will be clearly seen by an epigram from Martial
(viii 69):

miraris veteres, Vacerra, salas,
nec laudas nisi mortuos poetas.
ignescas petimus, Vaeerra; tanti
nonest, ut placeam n'ae', perire.

This is an instance os the reversed constr.: ‘death is too high a price
to pay sor the prize of your applause.’ But Martial might have used
the original form with precisely the same meaning, the clauses being
reversed:

tanti

nonest, ut peream, tibi placere.
