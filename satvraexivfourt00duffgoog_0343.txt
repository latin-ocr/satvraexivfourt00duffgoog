alonet bnt Paris has such influence at court, that he can secure his
friend's promotion.

90. histrio=pontominms, which is inadmissible in dactylie mette:
the word properly means ‘actor,' but is restricted, under the empire, to
the meaning ‘dance1’-a proof of the exclusive popularity of this kind .
os spectacle.

9¹· Barea (cf. 3, 116) and Camerinus (cf. 8, 38) are taken as typical
aristocrats.

magua ama ouras: Martia] too considers this an unsatisfactory
profession: e-g. iii 38, 11 ‘atria magno colam? ve'oc tres aut quattuor
ista Ι res aluin- pollet cetero turbo fame.

92. Pelopea and Philomela are both names of solidae salinae
which Paris may have represented. The meaning is that the actor
grants access to the equestrian cursushonorum: for praefecti and tn'bum',
see n. to creram cohortis r, 58.

'Ihe comment of the Scholiast on this l. is as follows ε propter hunc
versum messus cst in exilio (sic) a Claudio Nerone. For Juvenal’s exile
and its cause, see Introd. pp. xii, xiii.

93. haut...1nvldeas, ‘one need not envy’; ie. he is not so well off
after all. For the consta, cf. Cic. de Off. iii 110 haudfocrle quisdixerit:

94, 95. Cf. 5,108 foll. This complaint of the decay of patronage
might be illustrated at any length from Martial: cf. esp ,viii 56, 5 sunt
Maecenates, non deerunt, Flaccc, Nerones, and Mart. quoted on 5, 109.
C. Proculeius was a friend of Augustus, and is mentioned by Horace
(Carne. ii a, 5) as a generous man; Paulus Fabius Maximus was (like
Cotta3 see n. to 5, roolapatron of ovid; Lentulus cannot with certainty
be identified among the many Lentuli Cornelii.

97. pallore: this was the natural result of the sedentary and
exhausting life of a poet: cf. Hor. Epp. i 19, 17 (of his imitators) quod

on a man who confused cause and effect: vii 4 essct, Castrice, cum
mali coloris, Ι versus scribere coepit Oppionus.

vinum...1>eoombr1: all classes allowed themselves some relaxation
and enjoyment at the Saturnalia (Dec. 17-19); hence Mart. xiii r, 4
