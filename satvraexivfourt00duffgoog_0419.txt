may be compared, of the nurse who carried an ugly child every day to
the temple of Helen, ὅκως δὲ ἐνείκειε ἡ τροφός, πρός τε τῶγαλμα tara sal
ἑλίσσετο τὴν θεὸν ἀπαλλάξαι τῆς δυσμορφίης τὸ παιδίον.

29ο. Veneris: she is the givet of venustas, beauty and charm.

fanum videt: see n. to 1, 116.

²91· nsque ad delictas votorum, ‘even to fancifulness in her
prayers‚' i.e. praying even for trifles: deliciae often has the meaning
‘airs and graces’ (see n. to 6, 47) and sometimes the sense of
delicatus homa (see n. to 4, 4); the idea is the same here. The
word might denote either a feeling in the mind of the person pray-
ing, or a quality in the obJ'ect prayed for3 in the present instance,
’ the latter seems more likely. The meaning is, that mothers are not
content to ask simply for beauty; they want something more out of the
common, specifying eg. the colour of hair or eyes they wish their
children to havet cf. Sen. de Ben. iv 5, 1 nequeenim necessitatibus
tantummodo nastris previsum est: usque in delicias amamur (ie. the
gods not only provide us with necessaries but show their love by
providing us with luxuries as well); id. Epp. 9ο, 16 simplici cura
constant necessasia: in delicias abaram (where the two things are
opposed in just the same way). In the present instance, farma may be
called the necessitas, but mothers are not content with that, unless they
secure the deliciae (superfluities) as well.

²93· Lucretia is the wife of Collatinus, who killed herself when
outraged by Sextus Tarquinius: cf. Livy i 57 foll.

294. Rutila is no doubt an actual person, whose deformity was
familiar to Juv.’s contemporaries; Virginia is the beautiful girl, whom
her father killed to save her from the lust of Appius Claudius: cf.
Livy iii 44 foll.

295. mam: P has suum which Biiclr. keeps, supplying gibbum in
the sense of papillas, which seems impossible. The writing is somewhat
careless, butsaciem is the word which must be supplied from l. 293.

autam, ‘agaim' ‘on the other hand’3 a good and classical use of
the word.
