commentary. I also owe much to Professor L. Friedlander’s
edition, but not more, Ι think, than to his other works
mentioned above, especially the Sittengesclriclzte: the Indices,
also, to his editions of Martial and Juvenal are a real
boon. When his edition was published, Ι had prepared
more than half my commentary for the Press3 but from
that time onward I constantly kept his book before rne,
and was also able to make some changes in the proof-
sheets of what Ι had already written. Weidners edition,
which Ι had been consulting before with little advantage, Ι
discarded almost entirely when I had Friedlander before me.
The only other edition which I have regularly used is that
of the late J. D. Lewis: its great merits are good sense and
power of apt quotation. I have studied the papers on
Juvenal in Madvig's Opuscula and, in almost every case,
accepted his conclusions. Ι must also mention a large
number of articles and notes by different scholars in the
philological Reviews‚ English and German—especially the
¹ series of papers by Biicheler in the cht'nisclrcs Muscam.
My obligations to all these authorities are, Ι believe, ac-
knowledged on any passage where I accept their views.
Finally, I owe a special debt of gratitude to Mr W. T.
· Lendrum, Fellow of Gonville and Caius College. He has
read nearly the whole of the commentary in proof3 and
almost every page bears marks of his fine scholarship and
exact knowledge of Roman institutions under the Empire.
