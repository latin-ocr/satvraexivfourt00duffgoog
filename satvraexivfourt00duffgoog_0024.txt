that Juvenal wrote and published, or at least recited, salites
before the death of Domitian, the chronological problem, obscure
enough already, becomes further complicated. lf the seventh
satire refers to Domitian as a patron of literature (this is

Nettleship’s opinion), while the fourth satire refers to his
death as past history, no safe inferences can be drawn from the
order in which the satires now stand.

But the statement is ill-authenticated, and involves very
serious difficulties. On what subject was it safe to write satire
under Domitian? To attack the Emperor, or his courtiers, or

public institutions, was out of the question. ls it credible that
Juvenal stooped to flatter like Martial? Again, how is it that
Martial, an intimate friend, writing to Juvenal from Spain about
101 nn, while describing generally his friend's course of life,
says not a word of satires? The biographers statement is
probably a fiction. lt is dealt with incidentally in the two
following sections.

The Evidence of tlte Satires.

We get upon surer ground, when we turn to the satires
themselves, and examine how far we can ascertain their dates
by internal evidence1.

They were not all published together: no book of the ancient
form could have held them all. Nor were they published
singly; but like many works of Latin authors, such as the
satires and epistles of Horace and the epigrams of Martial,
they were published in ‘books' (libelli) at different dates, each
book containing somewhat less than a thousand linesh This
division into books is preserved in many manuscripts ; and the
grammarians quote Juvenal by it: eg. Iuvenalis in secundo
refers to the sixth satire. Hence, if we can date any satire, the

1 The dates here given are those of F riedl'ander.

² Juvenal speaks in the first satire (l. 86) of noster libellus: the word
could not be used either of the first satire or of the whole sixteen, but is
quite appropriate of the first five together.
