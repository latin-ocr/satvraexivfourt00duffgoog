you attack the vices 01 the great who are still living, you will be severely
punished and your task isa fruitless one.’ For just the same reasons
Pliny (Epp. v 8, ra) declines to write a history of his own times: graves
effinsoc, levis gralia, ‘I shall give serious offence and get little thanksss
If the epithets latum and meda'o are objected to, the answer is that
Juv. intends by them to denote the parade and circumstance with which
the fruitless task is set about.

(Ι had arrived at this explanation some time before 1 found that it
had been already suggested by Professor Palmer in his edition 01 Ovid’s
Heroides (1874) p. 44.) ¹

. 158. dedit: dare, διδόναι, are the technical words 101 administering
medicine; hence our ‘dose’ from δόσις. Μ.

vehatur: deliberative subj.

159. plnm1s,downpillows,asign 01 great luxury: cf. 6, 88; 10, 361. i

161. ‘'Tis defamation but to say, ‘that’s he l¹' The antecedent of
qui is the subj. 01 m't. To point out the criminal in the street is as -
dangerous 101 yourself as to accuse him formally in court.

Some edd. supply ei as antecedent to qui: thus the sentence is equiv.
to rcus crit qui aerem. This is equally good Latin but less forcible.

verbnm, ‘a single word’: the omission 01 unum is characteristic
of the best and most idiomatic Latin: cf. Ter. Andr. 860 verbum si
addiderim Cic. pro Quinct. 93 id. pro Rosc. Am. ²3 idio Verr. ii 46.

For verbum, P has veroum: the substitution of v for b is one of its
commonest errors: thus it gives oerocrc sor verbero (15, 11), and vivat
for bibat (11, 203). The corrector of P corrupted veroum to vnum.

161. The ‘haughty Rutulian’ is Turnus who is ‘matched’ with
Aeneas in Virgil's epic.

163. num...acn111ea‚ ‘nobody resents the slaughter of Achilles’3
nulli is used sor nemini sor metrical reasons.

164. Hylas, the favourite page of Heracles who fell into a well
when drawing water, in the Argonautie expedition: cf. Theocr. 13.

165. Here begins the δέ clause, in opposition to ll. 161 foll.

167. criminibus: see n. to 1. 75.

testimoium is not co·ordinate with rubet auditor but with the
clause, cui...cn‘minibus: the asyndeton is common even where there is
no opposition between the clauses.

168. indo...laorlmae: cs. Ter. Andr. 116 hinc illae lacrumoe; a
common proverb, which perhaps Terence gave form to.

169. galeatum: the galea was carried by tlte soldier and not put

- 011 till the enemy were sighted.
