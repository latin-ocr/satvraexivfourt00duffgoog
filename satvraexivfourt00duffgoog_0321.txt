Vat. ¹4 eum puerorum extis deos aronis raaetare soleas); but to save
himself, he will turn informer (delator), and get his patroness into

553. Chaldaeis ‘astrologers’z thls name and mathematici (l. 562)

are generally reserved lor fortune-tellus, while astrologus* denotes an
orthodox student oi the science; but here astrologus is not an astro-

nomer‚ butan astrologer. The Chaldaica doctm'na was first systematised
about 250 uc. by Berosus a priest in Babylom and the name Chaldaei
was applied to all who told fortunes by the stars. Os the immense
influence of these men in that age there is abundant evidence: Tacitus
repeatedly mentions decrees os the senate expelling all mathematici from
Italy: cs. Ana. ii 32, xii 523 Hist. ii 62; also Hist. i aa where they
are described as genus hominum potentibus infidum, sperantibus fallax,
quod in cioe'tate nostra et vetabitur semper et retinebitur.

554. a tonte...Hammonlo, ‘comes straight from the spring os
Ammon’: cf. Tac. Ana. vi 21 quae dixerat [Thrasyllus] oracli vice

in North Africa where Zeus Ammon was worshipped3 one of the
curiosities of the place was a spring of water which was warm by
night and cold by day; cf. Herod. iv 1813 Lucr. vi 848 soll.

Lucan v rrr non ulla saecula dona Ι nostra carent aratore deum, quam
Delphica sedes Ι quod siluit, postquam reges timuere futura Ι et superos
aetum loqui. ΤΙιε evidence of Strabo shows that, by the time os
Augustus, the most famous oracles, Delphi, Dodona, and Ammon, had
fallen into neglect. The reason of this was that the Romans were
indifferent to oracular responsas, being content with their haruspices and
Sibylline books. Yet under the Antoninos the oracles again became
of considerable importance; and the emperor Julian consultio the
oracle oi Delphi about 360 tur).
