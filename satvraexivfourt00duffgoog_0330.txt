266 JUVENAL, vr.

Tac. Anu. xii 66 ; Suetonius mentions a report that Claudius was
poisoned by his own fraster’ at a public banquet (Claud. 44).

633. papas is sound only in inscriptions elsewhere: it cannot mean

‘lond father' (so Weidn.), as (ι) the pupilli are orpham, (a) the Latin
Ι equivalent of our ‘dada' is tdta. We should expect paedagogus, which
the mette will not allow; probably this is a child’s name for the same.

634. ‘Yon say, l invent this, and satire puts on the high buskin;
and going beyond the limits of satire and the rules of my predecessors,
l cry out in frenzy’ etc. See Introd. p. xxxiii.

The position ol scilibet would be more usual it it changed places
with fingimus belows the meaning is like that os at cuim in prose.

636. Sophocles is mentioned as the typical tragic poet: ct'. Mart.
v 30, 1 Varro, Sophocleo uon itfittimde cothurno.

638. nos utinam vani, sc. essemus, ‘would that mine were an idle
talel' Pontia is twice mentioned as a poisoner by Martial iv 43, 5;
vi 75; cs. also ii 34, 6 o niuster, qua nec Pontia deterior. The Scholiast
says she was a daughter of Publius Petronius, who was condemned sora
conspiracy against Nero. She was convicted of poisoning her sons and
committed suicide A well-attested instance of this crime is mentioned
by Statius (Situ. v ι, 76-97): a modern bard, in complimenting a
friend, would not recal the lact that the friend's mother had been
executed lor attempting to poison her own son. The Crispinus there
addressed was a pupillus (l. 629).

Fortem, ‘I am guilty‚' sce n. to secz'ssct 4, ιι.

639. aconita: sor this poison, cl. 1, 158.

640. tamem is sound, means ‘in any case‚' ie. even if the poison
had not been detected3 but the expression isso strange that it seems
'possible that a contraction sor tautum (adj.) has been mistaken by the
copyists. See E. M. Thompson's Palaeogtuplzy p. 98.

641. For the omission os the verb, here sustulisti or of like mean·
ing, seen. to 1, 1 : so sustulissem must be supplied in the next line.

643. ‘Let us take the word ol the tragic poets for all the tales os
fierce Medea and Procne’3 both are stock examples of mothers who
killed their children.

644. conor, sc. dicere: cs. ιζι quotiens aliquid de moribus αιιιίιηί
(sc. dicere); ιο, 175. ot, ‘also.’

647. Ifa full stop is placed alter monstris (so Biich.), illarum must
be understood with monstris, as the modern crimes of which Juv. speaks

are summa monstra just as much as the crimes oi nichea and Procne.
The ⁰ml⁵⁵¹⁹0¹b however, of illarumis so barsls skatts seems necessary m
