Martial applies to Juvenal the epithet facundus. Does the
epithet show that Juvenal was known to him as a poet, or as a
rhetorician? Neither inference can be drawn with certainty, as
Martial elsewhere applies the word both to Virgil and to Cicero.
But, if Juvenal had written no satires at that time and was
only known to Martial as a student of rhetoric, the epithet
is perfectly appropriate. On the other hand, if Juvenal had
written satires before this date, or even before 101, it is incon·
ceivable that Martial, so ready to praise far humbler literary
efforts of his friendS, should not mention them. This is another
proof that Juvenal did not publish satires till after the death of
Domitian.
ln the second place, the last epigram (xii 18) represents
Juvenal's life very much as he represents it himself: Martial
contmsts his own easy days and restful nights in Spain with the
annoyances Juvenal continues to undergo while toiling up the
hilly streets, in the noise and heat of Rome, on his way to pay
court to the rich and powerful.
lt may be added here that there are some obvious imitations
reminiscences of Martial in the satires, especially the earlier
et, and also that there is a remarkable correspondence
men the work of the two writers, ‘not only in their views
of literature, but in the subjects they trent, the persons they
mention, their language and expression, and their general
t0ne¹·.' Ample evidence of this will be found in the notes to
this edition; but it seems unnecessary‚ in order to account for
this likeness, to suppose, as Nettleship doeS, that they were in
the habit of working together. The facts which have been
stated above, go to prove that Martial ceased to write about the
time when Juvenal begam and the resemblance will not seem
more than can be accounted for, if we believe that Juvenal,
haffing already a thorough knowledge of Martial's epigrams,
began to direct his satires against the same period and persons
Wh0m Martial had already riddled with his lighter artillery.
