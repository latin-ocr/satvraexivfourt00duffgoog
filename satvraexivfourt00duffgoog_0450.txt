69. velo prora suo: some ancient ships had a small foresail, called
delon which could be set, not on the mast, but on the prow. prora,
which as subject is used for navis, has its restricted sense iu this part
of the sentence.

70. matus Iulo etc: Ascanius (or Iulus) lest Lavinium, which
Aeneas had founded and named after lavinia, in possession of Lavinia,
his stepmother, and founded Alba Longa, beneath the Alban Mount.

71. Lamo: the town is generally called Lavinium, but an adj.

levinus is found (eg. Virg. Aen. i a) derived from a name Lavirmn ;

which is used here. Virgil has both Lauina and leini.

yn. sublimis apex, i.e. Mons Albanus. This portent of a white ’

sow with a litter of thirty (cf. 6, 177) was twice foretold to Aeneas, by
Helenus (Aen. iii 389) and by Tiberinus, ib. viii 43 littoreis ingens
inventasub ilicibus sus, Ι triginta capilum setus enixa, iacebit, Ι alba, solo

recubans, albi circum ubera nati. Ι hic loeus urbis m't, requies ea certa J

labarum, Ι ex quo terdenis urbem redeuntibus annis Ι Ascanius clari

candet cognominis Albam. The number of pigs presaged the number of
years before the founding of Alba. i

73. mirabile sumam cf. Virg. Aen. viii 81 (of this sow) mirabile i

monstrum. Btich. keeps mirarabile of P, which the Schol, who
recognises both readings, explains quod miseratum sit Phrygibus:
for adjectives in bilis with active meaning, sce Munro on Lucr. i 11:
but there are no other certain examples in Juv, and it seems more
probable that the copyist’s eye wandered to l. 67.

In Ovid Heroid. xii 99 all uss. read facinus miserabile except the best
(Puteanus) which hasf mirabile: so it seems there was some tendency
to confuse the two words.

surnen is a satirical equivalent effeta sus.

74. numquam vbis, ‘never seen,’sc. elsewhere. It is not meant
that the Trojans never really saw such a thing but that such sights are
rare. The phrase is peculias but seems to be an equivalent for invisi·
tatis, a word which Livy often uses of extraordinary sights, eg. xlv 42,
rr naves invisitatae ante magnitudinis3 and (without ante) v 35, 4 curn
formas bominum invisitatas cernerent. Ἴ

75. The port of Rome was Ostia, at the mouth of the Tiber. The ¹
river-deposit, which has left the ancient harbour over a mile inland,
made frequent operations and improvements necessary. The partus
Augusti was constructed by Claudius, two miles to the north of Ostia,

ancl connected with the 'liber hy a canal. Cf. Suet. Claud. ao portum
Ostiae exlrrexit, circumducto dextra sinistraque bacchio ct ud turritam
