y 73. Mml: Romuli would no doubt be preferred, if it were equally
convenient metrically: in hendecasyllabic verse Catullus (49, ι) calls
Cicero disertissima Romuli nepotum. Quiriniis often used for Romuli,
eg. 8, ²59·

74. tlortla, the Etruscan goddess of Fortune, worshipped especially
at Volsinii, the birth-place of Sejanus: hence Tusco ‘her Tuscae-³

75. secura, ‘off his guard,’ is part of the supposition; Tiberius was
not in any sense securus: cf. Suet. Tib. 63-66.

76. diceret=erdhet ἄν, ‘would be calling'

77. κυῶ-ψ nulli vendimus: the great constitutional change, by

' which the people ceased to be an clement of the constitution, and the
electiori of magistrates was transferred from the popular assemblies to
the senate, was effected by Tiberius am. 14: cf. Tac. Ann. i 15 tuta
primum e campo coniitia adpatres translata sunt: nam ad cam diem, etsi
potdsima (the consular electionsl) arbitrio pn‘naJoin quaedam tamen
studiis tribuum fiebant. neque populus adcntptum ius questus est πίει·
inani rumore—a sufficient proof of their unworthiness. Caligula pro-
fessed to make some attempt to restore their electoral rights (Suet. Cal.
16).

78. vendimus, substituted παρὰ προσδοκίαν for damus with an
ironical reference to the bribery which was almost universal at electioris
in the latter days of the republic: indeed the same word (ambitus)
meant ‘canvassing’ and ‘bribery'

eruut curae, ‘has cast off its burdens,’ i.e. of public affairs: cf. Tac.
Hert. i 1 inscitia reipublicae ut alienae: the point is not that the people
are anxious to have Sejanus rule over them, but they are indifferent
and will acquiesce in any accomplished fact.

79. importum, ‘power,' the administrative authority wielded by
all the higher magistrates, at Rome aud, with less restriction, beyond
the city. se continet, ‘narrows its field!

80. uuas...res: see n. to 8, 118.

81. punem: the system of supplying corn below the maritet-price
to the populace at Rome, was introduced by Gaius Gracchus 13.c. 123.
Later demagogues, especially Clodius, went further and supplied it for
nothing (cf. Cic. pro Sest. 55). The consequence was that poor citizens
finched from all parts of ltaly to the capital, where they lived as idle aud
dangerous paupers. Julius Caesar reduced the number of corn-receivers
frum 320‚ooo to 150‚ooo (Suet. Iul. 41); but even he could not abolish
the system, which denioralised the reeipxents and buxdened the public
