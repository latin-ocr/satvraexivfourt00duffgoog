nudam govern them; but the existing representations are against this,
and amientis is very feeble by itsels. Nor can any real parallel be given
for clspeo=cum clipea. Hence some emend: eg. Merry reads cliaeoquc
nitentis (fulgentis is read by the inferior tiss.); Mitller, in clipeo. .

Ι believe the text to be sound, and that Juv. is using venientia in its
well established sense of ‘attacking'; cf. l. 113 and Munro on Lucr.
iii 833 ‘venio is continually used by Livy for the hostile advance of
soldiers.’ If venientis has this sense, the ablatives are common instru-
mentals like Gorgone (='clipe0) ra, 4. No doubt, the artist represented
Mars as borne on the wings oi love to Rbea Silvia; but Juv. wishes to
emphasise the other aspect oi the god, swooping down as a destroyer on
the doomed enemies os his Roman posterity.

108. The pottery oi Etruria is oiten mentioned, as cheap and
common. For 1111111, which = pultes, see 11. tol. 58.

109. Perhaps a reminiscenee 01 Livy xxii 51, 4 (01 the spoil taken
by Hannibal at Cannae tac. 116) praeter equos virosque et si quid
argmti—quodplurimum in phaleris equorum (cf. l. 103) erat,· nam ad ·
vescendum farto perexiguo, utique militantes, utebantur-omnir cetera
praeda diripienda dala est.

110. Le. a man must be covetous indeed, to covet the simple con·
trivances of those days. lividulus: cs. sordidula 3, 14'93 inprobulum
5, 733 pallidulus 10, 81; rancrttula 11, 1353 here and in some of the
other instances, the diminutive sense seems latent ; but such forms are
appropriate to colloquial language and hence to satura.

111. praecanam, ‘more near 1ο help us’; cf. 3, 18. Tm story os
this divine φημή is told by Livy v 32, 6: it was heard at night near the
temple of Vesta at the foot oi the Palatine, and told the hearer to warn
the magistrates that the Gauls were coming 3 but no attention was paid
to it until it came true.

113. litore ab Oceani: this is a rhetorical ornament taken appa·
rently [rom Livy v 37, a invisitata atque inaudito hoste ab Oceano
terrarumque ultimis oris bellum cient. Part of Gaul was bounded by
the Ocean; but, by Livy’s own account, these Gauls had been settled in
Etruria for aoo years. For veneantur, ‘attacking’ (cf. bellum ciente
in Livy), see 11. 10 1. 106. This invasion took place tac. 391.

114. The stop at peragentibus is due to Madvig, who explains tria
as=ltac voce et hurnsmodi sz'gnia The stop was formerly placed aiter
nos, vox being taken as subject to nronuit3 annulantes maffia&-
