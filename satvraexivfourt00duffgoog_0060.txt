pocula. But he does not go on to explain how the wicked
owe to their guilt an abstemious philosopher. Now compare

the Scholia Pithoeana on these two passages. On togatas
we find, ‘togatae sunt comoediae Latinae, quales Afranius
secit': on cuprum, ‘dicit emblematum opus! The comparison
shows indeed, as Jahn says, quid dirimi aera lupinis.

The Scholia of Cornutus are very copious‚ but a detailed
account os them is superfluous. By their dim light the Middle
Ages studied their corrupt text oi Juvenal ; they were repeatedly
copied and circulated in Mss. from the 9th century onwards,
and are generally found with little variation in the interpolated
Mss.¹ They were also written in a later hand on the margin
of P—the same hand which added the Lite at the end os the
Ms.-but have been crossed out by some judicious reader
(Pithou himself, according to Beer), whose pen has spared the
good Scholia.

These latter are found in P-hence their name of Pitlzoenna-
and also were included in all the fragmentary Mss. which preserve
the same recension as P3 and, as was said above, they are pre-
served without a text in a MS. at St Gall. The great importance
of these Scholia, and their unique value for settling the text os
Juvenal, have been shown incidentally in the previous section:
in many cases their lemmata give a reading older and better
than that oi P itsels. lt is clear that, as they now stand, they
are the work of more than one hand; but the more valuable
annotations were probably taken from a commentary on Juvenal,
attributed to a scholar called Probus on the authority os Ο.- Valla,
who, in his edition of Juvenal published at Venice in 1486, gave
extracts from a MS, now lost, containing ‘Probi grammatici in
Iuvenalem commentarii! These notes went no further than
Sat. 8, 198. Valla treated his materials‚ aster the fashion of his
time, with some sreed0m; but a comparison of his quotations

² Jahn’s inierence (prolegom. ad Persium p. cxvi) that this commen·
tary was printed in the Louvain edition oi Juvenal (1475), is apparently
incorrect. There is a copy oi this rare book in Peterhouse Library; it
has no printed commentary.
