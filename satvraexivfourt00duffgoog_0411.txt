comitatum 1111111111 does not refer to the bridge 01 boats (see
1. 176) but only to the size ol the fleet: cf. Livy xxxv 49, 5 (01
Antiochus, who made no bridge) rex...consternit maria classibus suis.

176. This relers to the bridge over the Hellespont made by
Xerxes, preparatory to his invasion 01 Graece. The same meaning
would be given more simply by impositas neeri rotas, rotae being the
chariots which passed over. -

to omit this picturesque detail, felt some qualms about it.

178. prandente, ‘breakfasting' is sarcastic: cl. Mart. iv 49, 3 qui
scribit prandea saevi! Tereos. Xerxes did not require an ἄριστον but

180. solitus, ‘he who had been wont.' When the bridge over the
Hellespont was made, it was broken by a storm; Xerxes ordered
300 lashes to be inflicted on the sea and letters to be sunk into it, with
an insulting address (Herod. vii 35). The historian adds that he ‘had
heard’ that Xerxes sent branders also to brand the sea.

181. barbarus may imply either cruelty or solly: as Xerxes may be
charged with both, it is difficult to say which Juv. means 10 conveyhere.
In the narrative 01 Herodotus (vii 35 ἐνετέλλετο ῥαπίζοντας λέγειν βάρβαρά
