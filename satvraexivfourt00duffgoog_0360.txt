SATIRE VIII.

ΟΝ NOBLE BIRTH.

1-38; There is no advantage in a long line os distinguished ancestors,
if their descendant and representative is viciam and effeminate, ond
a disgrace to his forefathers. Virtue is the only tmce nobility‚ and ,
blue blood must come second to honour andgoodness. Weakness and
wichedness are only mm conspicuous when attached to a grentoni
famous name.

1. stemmata, ‘family-trees! In a Roman noble's house the atrium
was adorned by imagines, wax portrait·masks ol deceased aucestors,
each preserved in a separate cabinet (armarium) with an inscription
(titulus) below. The ius imaginum was restricted to those who had
held curule office. Whetber these masks were placed upon busts, is un·
certain; if so, they could be detached, as they were worn by actors in
the funeral processIon of any member os the family. CI. Pliny Nat. Hist.
xxxv 6 apud maures in atriis...expressi cera uoltus singulis dispone-
bantur armariis, ut essent imagines quae comitarentur gentilicia funera,
semperque defuncto aliquo totus oderat familiae eius qui unquam suerat
populus. stemmata vero lineis discurrebant ad (to correspond with)
imagines pictas. The last sentence indicates that the imagines were
distinct srorn the stemma, the latter being a genealogIcal chart (cl.
generis tabula l. 6), thch was so called because the names on it were
illuminated with painted garlands. The same distinction between
insagines and stemma appears in Sen. de Ben. iii 28, n qui imagines in
atrio exponunt et nomina familiae suae...multis stemmatum inlegmta
flexuris in parte prima aedium collocant. (In distinguishIng imagines
from stemma, and in the quotatlons to prove the distinction, 1 follow
Mr Lendrum in Hermathena vi p. 360.)

qutd faciunt? ‘are useless,' ‘ absurd’: the use olfacere is idi0matic:
cf. Mart. vii 64, 6 qnidfacit infelix ctfugiteba quies?

Ponticus is again addressed ll. 75, 179; the name rnoy be invented
that the satire may be addressed to some one in particular: see n. to
Postumus 6, 28.
