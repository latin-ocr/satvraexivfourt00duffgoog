302 Juvnrvnr, v111.

55. tua...rmago, ‘while you are a living statue'; though alive,
which the marble is not, you are just as useless.

56. 'l'ouororum proteo=Troiugena of 1, roo where see n.

muta, ie. without articulate speech: sometimes a noun, eg. 15, 143.

58· ulo=quod fortis cst.

raom...01rm‚ ‘to whom, an easy winner, falls many a hotly·con·
tested palm, and for whom the shout ο1 victory swells in the roaring
Circus? fociliis dat. agreeing with cui; plurimo may be taken with
victorio as well as with palmo. For the noise in the Circus, cf. 11, 197·

61. ruga, ‘speed'; cl. Virg. Acn. 1 317 volucremque flego proo-
vertitur Hebrum.

pulvis is the cloud of dust raised on the course (aequor) by the horse
as he runs: cs. Mart. vi 38, 7 ocris equi suboles magno sic pulvere
gaudet (where perhaps magno is a gloss, the right reading being circi
which had magni written over it; then magni ousted circi from the
tert and was made to agree with pulvere).

62. venale, sc. est, ‘come to the hammer? pecus is contemptuous.
Coryphaeus and Hirpinus are the names ol famous racc-horses3 cl.
Mart. iii 63, ra Hirpini veteres qui bene novit avos.

63. rara, ‘seldom'z the adj. is much oftener used· in Latin than

the adv: so also frequens. lugo: the horses in the Circus-races were
always driven, not ridden.

64. 1111, ‘in their case,’ although a worthless noble may be
respected. M. explains, ‘in the Circus’: but cf. 11, 176.

66. epiraedia: the word is mentioned by Quintilian (i 5, 68) as a
hybrid, cpi being Greek and roedo Celtic, though the whole compound
is used as a Latin word: the meaning is usually given as ‘traces’ ; but
ducunt seems to suggest some kind ol carriage or cart.

67. nepot0s‚=postm'tas, is subject to iubentur and ducunt: old
edd. generally read Nepotis which most Mss. give, but the reading of P¹
is certainly right: M. quotes an inscription in which a horse (Hirpinus 1
ef. Mart. quoted above) is called nepos Aquilonis. The pistrinum was
often turned by asses, sometimes, as a punishment, by slaves.

68. privum ailquid da, ‘instance something ol your own’; cl.
Ovid quoted on l. 41. privum is Salmasius’ certain correction ol
primum which all mss. give. The same corruption is found in the
uss. ol Lucr. iii 372, where Bentley restored privis lor primis.

69. utum, ‘the inscription’ on your statue or bust; see n. to

1, 130.
70· 11111, ie. mozon‘bus tuis.
