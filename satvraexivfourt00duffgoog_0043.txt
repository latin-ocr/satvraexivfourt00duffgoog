INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

to please orto instruct, hardly even to reform; he tells us

repeatedly in his introductory satire that his only source of
inspiration is his buming anger against vice aud crime. He
was quite conscious that he was making satire do a work it
had never done before-that, to use his own words, ‘he was
ignoring the limits and objects of former satirists‚ and that
satire was putting on the high buskin' of tragedy or epic¹.
His innovations could not be better described.

Now moral indignation must command respect, especially
when it is expressed with fearless indifference to consequences.
But some critics have maintained that Juvenal’s ‘indignation' is
the mere literary convention of a man with a gift for satire and
a resolve to write it; and that his brave words exposed him to
no risks‚ because the abuses which he attacked had ceased to
exist. This raises two distinct questions which must be brielly
considered. first, was Juvenal a hero like the Hehrewprophets,
who rebuked wicked kings to their faces? Secondly‚ was
Juvenal an honest man, oris his moralising attitude a mere
pretence?

ln secking to answer these questions, we are again confronted
by the difficulties of chronology3 probability must be our guide.
'In the first place, Juvenal himself tells us that he intends to
turn his satire against the dead, because it is too dangero'us to
attack the living2. And this is what he seems actually to have
done. Nettleship truly says that ‘Juvenal’s manner is at times
so unreal that it is impossible for the reader to be sure whether
the poet is referring to contemporary events or only professing
to do so' This is just the reason that weakens Nettleship’s
argument for the early date of the seventh satire, based upon the
persons there mentioned. Juvenal’s idea of historical perspectiv
is very peculiar. Thus in Sat. 13 (l. 157) he speaks of Gallio
as if he were then prefect of the city; but the satire was writtt
about 127 nn„ and we know from Statius³ that Gallicus W·
