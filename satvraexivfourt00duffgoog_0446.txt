382 Juvuunn, xn.

A poetica tempestas with all possible details will be found in [Seneca]
Agamem. 483-599. Juv. seems a little sceptical of his friend¹s account
oi his disasters.

25. quamquam alni: for the mood, see n. to 7, 14.

ay. votiva...taballa‚ a picture, representing the danger escaped,
which is hung on the temple wall in gratitude for deliverance; many
such may be seen in Italian churches. Especially those saved from
shipwreck showed their gratitude in this way: edd. quote Cic. de Nat.
Deor. iii 89 nonne animadvertis ex tot tabulis pictis, quam multi votis
vim tempestatis ffugerint in portumque salvi pervenerint? A different
use of such a picture is mentioned 14, 30²·

28. Painters ‘are supported by Isis‚’ because they get their breed
by painting votivae tabellae ior her temple: she was supposed to heve
great power to help, when a ship was sinking.

31· uternam puppis latus, ‘first one side oi the ship and then the
other': ci. Petron. rr 3 ecce iam ratem fluetus evertet.

32. arborls incanae: orbor is constantly used for ‘mast' in Latin
poetry, and even in prose: cf. Petron. ¹¹4 non arbor erat relicta, non
gubernacula, non fienis aut remus ; Pliny Epp. ix a6,4 cum stridunt
funes, curvatur arbor, greberrracula gemunt. It probably means ‘mast'
here, and, if so, is a gen. oi quality to be taken with alveus, ‘with
tottering mast,' an abl. absol. being inserted between the two epithets,
to show why the mast was tottering: so Madvig: ci. ιι, 96. Others
suppose, on slight authority, that arboris is ‘the ship,' and so take puppis
above as ‘stern,’ governing arboris. Lachmann read arbori incertae,
the dat. being governed by conferret opem3 but such a hiatus though
found elsewhere (eg. Virg. Ecl. 3, 79 volt inquit Iolla) is not found
in Juv. or his contemporaries.

canl, ‘white-haired‚' and therefore experienced.

33. tenoris, osten used ior gubernatoris3 but in prose navigii is
usually added.

decidere...cum ventis, ‘to eompound with the winds,’a commercial
phrase used of the debtor, who, unable to pay in full, bargains ior a
quittance by paying a part os his dcbt (portioh ci. Mart. ix 3, 5 con-
turbabit Atlas, et non erit uncia tota Ι decidat terum qua pater epse
deum (ie Jupiter will not be able to pay 1s.6d. in the pound): itis
osten, as here, metaphorically used: so Sen. Dial. xi η, 1 (to Polybius
who had lost a brother but had a wife and child and other brothers

living) pro omnivm trorum salute hae tecum portione fortuna deer'dit.
