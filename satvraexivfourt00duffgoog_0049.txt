of Sejanus's sall in the tenth satire ; but it is in his earlier
poems that they must chiefly be sought The third satire is
a long succession of such pictores, excellent in themselves
and put together with an artistic shill which elsewhere he
either disdains or cannot reach. lt is described as follows by
Mr Mackail¹z ‘ln this elaborate indictment of the lise of the
capital, put into the mouth of a man who is leaving it for a
. little sleepy provincial town, he draws a picture of the Rome he
knew, its social lile and its physical featureS, its everyday sights
and sounds, that brings it before us more clearly and sharply
than even the Rome os Horace or Cicero. The drip ol the
water from the aqueduct that passed over the gate from which
the dusty, squalid Appian way stretched through its long
suburb3 the garret under the tiles, where, just as now, the
pigeons sleeked themselves in the sun and the rain drummed
on the roos ; the narrow, crowded streets, half choked with the
builders' carts, ankle-deep in mud, and the pavement ringing
under the heavy military boots of guardsmen; the tavern
waiters trotting along with a pyramid of hot dishes on their
heads; the ilower·pots falling frorn high window·ledges; night,
with the shuttered shops, the silence broken by some sudden
street brawl, the darkness shaken by a flare oi torches as some
great man, wrapped in his scarlet cloak, passes along from a
dinner-party with his long train of clients and slaves: these
scenes live ior us in Juvenal, and are perhaps the picture of
' ancient Rome that is most abidingly impressed on our memory.’
Even in the narrow compass of a single line, Juvenal can
draw a picture, perfectly expressive of his meaning and indelible
in the memory os the reader. Let us take an example from
what is, on the whole, the weakest of the satires, the fifteenth.
The phenomenon which we express by saying ‘the schoolmaster ·⁵
is abroad,’ is put thus by Juvenal:

de conducendo loquitur iam rhetore Thyle.

1t is obvious that the Latin is immensely superior in dramati?-
