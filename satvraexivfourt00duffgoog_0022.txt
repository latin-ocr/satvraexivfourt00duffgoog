been extracted from the satires. There is therefore no reason
to reject this tradition, that Juvenal was “the son, or adopted
son, of a rich freedman, and practised rhetoric till about middle
age, more as an amusement than as a serious preparation for
teaching rhetoric or pleading in the courts.’' The latter state·

ment is abundantly confirmed by the rhetorical tone which
pervades his compositions. Such an occupation‚ though strange
to us, would be natural enough to a Roman. The practice of
speaking in the rhetorical schools was continued by many
throughout life as an intellectual pastime, and even by men who
had no intention of putting their skill to practical use in the
courts. It was one of the accomplishments of a gentleman to
have this powerl. Thus we leam from Μ. Seneca that Ovid
used constantly to practise speaking in the schools, and was
considered a skilful debate12. A man must, of course, have
had some means, in order to spend his time in a pursuit which
paid him nothing. But the Biography makes it probable that
Juvenal had some expectations of wealth‚ though it seems
likely, as we shall see below, that they were disappointed.
The remainder of the Life is inferior in style; and the
statements there made are suspicious. They seem to rest on
conclusions drawn from the satires³‚ combined with more or
less credible traditions. One exception, however, must be made.
Juvenal himself never alludes to his banishment ; and a tradition
to this effect is found in all the Lives, in several Scholia, and
also in later writers, eg. Sidonius Apollinaris in the fifth
century⁴. His punishment is ascribed to different emperors,
